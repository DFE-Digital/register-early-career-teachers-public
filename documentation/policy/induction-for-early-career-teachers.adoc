== Summary

This is statutory guidance from the Department for Education. This means
that those involved in managing statutory induction arrangements must
have regard to it when carrying out their relevant duties. The guidance
covers those settings which are both required to or choose to offer
induction to their early career teachers (ECTs). The term ‘early career
teacher’ refers to a newly qualified teacher in their first or second
year of induction.

=== Legislation this publication refers to

Sections https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/32/section/135A[135A],
https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/32/section/135B[135B] and
https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/32/section/141C[141C(1)(b)],
of the
https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/32/contents[Education Act 2002] and
https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/1115/contents/made[The Education (Induction Arrangements for School Teachers) (England) Regulations 2012] as amended.

=== Who this publication is for

This guidance is for:

* appropriate bodies – teaching school hubs; local authorities (subject
to <<para-2-24,2.24>>); and other organisations determined by the Secretary of
State who can act in this role;
* headteachers/principals, teachers and governing bodies in all
maintained schools, independent schools, academiesfootnote:[Throughout
this document ‘academies’ includes 16–19 and alternative provision
academies.] and free schools; and
* staff in other settings in which induction can be served – further
education (FE) colleges; sixth-form colleges; British schools overseas
(BSOs); nursery schools; and pupil referral units (PRUs).

=== Main points

* All qualified teachers who are employed in a relevant
schoolfootnote:[See <<para-2-1,para <<para-2-1,2.1>>>> for a list of relevant schools.] in England
must, by law, have completed an induction period satisfactorily, subject
to specified exemptions (see <<_annex_a_exemptions,Annex A>>).
* Statutory induction is not a legal requirement to teach in FE or the
independent sector, academies, free schools and BSOs, but may be served
in these settings.
* Early Career Framework (ECF) based training is expected to be embedded
as a central aspect of induction; it is not an additional training
programme.
* An appropriate body has the main quality assurance role within the
induction process. The appropriate body is responsible for checking that
headteachers/principals have put in place an induction programme for the
ECT and ensuring that this programme of support is clearly based on the
ECF.
* Monitoring and support throughout induction should be sufficient so
that an ECT’s progress against the Teachers’ Standards is not unexpected
when an ECT reaches a formal assessment point.

=== Document History

=== Summary of 2021 ECF reforms 

This guidance was significantly updated in March 2021 to reflect reforms
introducing an ECF-based induction. The following key changes were made:

* The term early career teacher (ECT) replaced the term newly qualified
teacher (NQT).
* The standard length of induction increased from one school year to two
school years (see para <<para-2-30,2.30>>).
* In addition to the 10% timetable reduction that ECTs receive in their
first year of induction, ECTs also receive a 5% timetable reduction in
their second year of induction (see para <<para-2-20,2.20>>).
* Schools are expected to deliver an induction period that is
underpinned by the ECF (see para <<para-2-40,2.40>>). Appropriate bodies have a role
in checking that an ECF-based induction is in place (see para <<para-5-11,5.11>>).
* The role of the mentor was introduced (see para <<para-2-43,2.43>>). The mentor has
a key role in supporting the ECT during induction and is separate to the
role of the induction tutor (see para <<para-2-45,2.45>>).
* There are two formal assessment points, one midway through induction,
and one at the end of the induction period (see para <<para-2-55,2.55>>). These are
supported by regular progress reviews to monitor progress, to take place
in each term where a formal assessment is not scheduled (see para <<para-2-48,2.48>>).
* ECTs working part-time may, on completion of a minimum period covering
but not equivalent to two full years, be able to have their induction
period reduced. It is for the appropriate body to consider whether to
grant a reduction and bring forward the final assessment point. This
decision is only to be made in agreement with the ECT and on the basis
that the ECT has met the Teachers’ Standards (see para <<para-3-5,3.5>>).
* The number of ad-hoc absences permitted was extended, in line with the
extended length of induction (see para <<para-3-6,3.6>>).

=== April 2023 updates

This guidance was further updated in April 2023 with changes coming into
effect from September 2023. The following key changes were set out at
that time and are still current:

* There will be changes to those organisations that can operate as an
appropriate body.
** From 1 September 2023, only teaching school hubs and other
organisations determined by the Secretary of State will be listed as
being able to act as appropriate bodies.
** During a transitional period from 1 September 2023 until 31 August
2024, local authorities can only continue to act as appropriate bodies
in a limited capacity where the local authority was acting as an
appropriate body for an institution immediately before 1 September 2023
for an ECT who was serving an induction period in that same institution
immediately before 1 September 2023 (see para <<para-2-24,2.24>>).

* The exemptions to a qualified teacher having satisfactorily completed
an induction period to be able to be employed in a relevant school in
England have been updated to reflect the changes brought about by the
introduction of a new approach to recognising overseas teaching
qualifications. Under this new approach, teachers from outside the
United Kingdom who are awarded QTS, having made an application to do so
after 1 February 2023, are required to complete induction if they have
less than two years’ full-time experience when they are awarded QTS. We
have also updated the exemptions for teachers who complete an induction
or probation period in the other parts of the United Kingdom and certain
overseas territories and Crown Dependencies (see <<_annex_a_exemptions,Annex A>>).
* Schools are expected to provide appropriate bodies with copies of all
progress reviews (see paras <<para-2-54,2.54>> and <<para-5-3,5.3>>).
* Where necessary the appropriate body is expected to ensure that the
headteacher/principal has contacted the ECT’s previous appropriate body
and has obtained the necessary reports to ensure induction can be
continued effectively. Where agreed with the headteacher/principal the
appropriate body may contact the ECT’s previous appropriate body to
obtain the necessary reports (see paras <<para-2-75,2.75>> and <<para-5-11,5.11>>-<<para-5-12,5.12>>).

In addition, the following clarifications to existing guidance have been
made:

* Pre-September 2021 cohort ECTs (see paras <<para-1-4,1.4>>-<<para-1-5,1.5>>) that on 1 September
2023 are serving an extension of their induction period decided by the
appropriate body, will only need to complete the agreed extension period
(see para <<para-1-6,1.6>>). This will only apply to pre-September 2021 cohort ECTs
who completed their three term induction before 1 September 2023, and
where following their final formal assessment the appropriate body
decides that an extension period is required in order to evidence
meeting the Teachers’ Standards (see paras <<para-3-8,3.8>>-<<para-3-10,3.10>>).
* ECT and mentor sessions are expected to be timetabled during teaching
hours. In exceptional circumstances however where schools require
flexibility due to timetabling constraints, mentoring may take place
outside of teaching hours but should always be scheduled within
contracted time (see para <<para-2-44,2.44>>).
* When scheduling or requesting progress reviews, induction tutors and
appropriate bodies are expected to consider when in the term an ECT
started their induction, if there are overlaps with a formal assessment
for part-time ECTs and if an ECT is absent at the point of a progress
review (see paras <<para-2-48,2.48>> and <<para-2-49,2.49>>).
* In exceptional circumstances where an interim assessment cannot be
completed before the ECT leaves post (for example in situations where an
absent ECT subsequently leaves their post without returning) the
induction tutor or headteacher/principal is still expected to complete
an interim assessment report and provide a copy to the ECT and
appropriate body (see para <<para-2-63,2.63>>).
* Where the appropriate body chooses to work with partners, the
appropriate body itself must retain full responsibility for regulatory
duties and powers including; overseeing induction; making direct
decisions in every case concerning the suitability of post and
institutions, taking appropriate action where schools are not complying
with requirements or actions taken to support the ECT’s progress and;
maintaining oversight of and accountability for all activities
undertaken by third parties (see para <<para-5-9,5.9>>).

=== What’s new from April 2024

This guidance has been updated since the previous version (issued April
2023). The following changes have been made:

* Educational Success Partners (ESP) has been added to the list of
organisations as determined by the Secretary of State to act as an
appropriate body, to support ECTs serving induction in British Schools
Overseas (paragraph <<para-2-24,2.24>>)
* Carer’s leave has been added to the list of types of absences which
are exempt from counting towards an automatic extension (paragraph <<para-3-7,3.7>>)

In addition the following clarifications to existing guidance have been
made on:

* How to calculate induction served for full and part time ECTs who
leave a contract of employment mid-term (paragraphs <<para-2-33,2.33>> to <<para-2-34,2.34>>)
* Removal of Secure Children’s Homes and Secure Training Centres from
the list of institutions where induction may not be served (legal
correction) (paragraph <<para-2-4,2.4>>)
* Considerations for appointing a suitable mentor (paragraph <<para-2-43,2.43>>)
* ECTs completing induction in England after having served part of their
induction in Wales, aligning English guidance with similar processes in
Wales recognising the appropriate body’s role and discretion in granting
a reduction on time served (paragraph <<para-3-2,3.2>>)
* The role of induction and appropriate bodies in relation to
performance management, reference to the existing exemption from
appraisal during induction has been added to paragraphs <<para-2-48,2.48>> and <<para-4-1,4.1>>,
with links to the capability procedures guidance included at paragraph
<<para-4-7,4.7>> and clarification of the boundaries of appropriate body’s role where
HR processes run alongside induction set out in paragraph <<para-4-8,4.8>>
* How the appropriate body must work with any third parties to ensure
they retain responsibility for their decisions (paragraph <<para-5-9,5.9>>)

== Section 1: Introduction

=== Purpose of induction

[arabic]
. [[para-1-1]] Statutory induction is the bridge between initial teacher training and
a career in teaching. It combines a structured programme of development,
support and professional dialogue, underpinned by the Early Career
Framework, with monitoring and an assessment of performance against the
Teachers’ Standards (see para <<para-1-9,1.9>>). The programme should support the
early career teacher and provide them with the necessary training to
ensure that they can demonstrate that their performance against the
Teachers’ Standards is satisfactory by the end of the period. Induction
should provide a foundation for ECTs and equip them with the tools to be
an effective and successful teacher.

=== The statutory framework

[arabic, start=2]
. [[para-1-2]] The statutory provisions which underpin this guidance are sections
135A-C and 141C(1)(b) of the Education Act 2002, and the Education
(Induction Arrangements for School Teachers) (England) Regulations 2012,
as amended, (hereafter referred to as ‘the 2012 Regulations’).
. [[para-1-3]] This guidance explains the provisions and helps individuals to comply
with the 2012 Regulations, which came into effect on 1 September 2012,
and which have been amended on a number of occasions since. The guidance
is not a complete and authoritative statement of the law, but anyone
exercising any function under the Regulations must have regard to the
guidance.

=== Transitional arrangements

[arabic, start=4]
. [[para-1-4]] The 2012 Regulations, as amended with effect from 1 September 2021,
extend induction from one year to two years. This will apply to ECTs who
start their induction on or after 1 September 2021.
. [[para-1-5]] ECTs who, on 1 September 2021, had started but not completed their
induction, hereafter referred to as ‘the pre-September 2021 cohort’ had
until 1 September 2023 to complete induction within three
terms[multiblock footnote omitted].
. [[para-1-6]] If an ECT in the pre-September 2021 cohort had concluded their
three-term induction before 1 September 2023 but the appropriate body
decided that an extension period was required in order to evidence
meeting the Teachers’ Standards which took the ECT past 1 September
2023, they will only have needed to complete the agreed period of
extension (see paras <<para-3-8,3.8>> - <<para-3-10,3.10>>).
. [[para-1-7]] Where possible, schools should have regard to this amended statutory
guidance in relation to ECTs who began their statutory induction before
1 September 2021. For example, where possible these ECTs should have an
ECF-based induction and a mentor for the remainder of their one-year
induction. This is to be decided by the headteacher and appropriate body
given what is most appropriate in the circumstances and considering what
proportion of the induction period remains to be served.
. [[para-1-8]] After 1 September 2023, when the transition period ends, all ECTs
(with the exception of those in the pre-September 2021 cohort who have
already concluded their three-term induction, as set out in para <<para-1-6,1.6>>)
will be required to complete a two-year induction period. These ECTs
should not restart induction, but rather complete the remaining period
of a two-year induction. It is expected that they will be able to access
ECF support and entitlements for the remainder of their induction.

=== The relevant standards

[arabic, start=9]
. [[para-1-9]] The Teachers’ Standards will be used to assess an ECT’s performance at
the end of their induction period. The decision about whether an ECT’s
performance against the relevant standards is satisfactory upon
completion of induction should take into account the ECT’s work context
and must be made on the basis of what can be reasonably expected of an
ECT by the end of their induction period within the context of the
standards. Judgements should reflect the expectation that ECTs have
effectively consolidated their initial teacher training (ITT) and
demonstrated their ability to meet the Teachers’ Standards consistently
over a sustained period in their practice. The ECF is not and should not
be used as an assessment tool.

=== Requirement to complete an induction period

[arabic, start=10]
. [[para-1-10]] Subject to the exemptions listed in <<_annex_a_exemptions,Annex A>> (see Schedule 1 of the
2012 Regulations), a qualified teacher cannot be employed as a teacher
in a relevant school in England unless they have satisfactorily
completed an induction period in accordance with the 2012 Regulations
and this guidance. While ECTs are encouraged to start their induction as
soon as possible after gaining qualified teacher status (QTS), there is
no set time limit for starting or completing an induction period. An
ECT’s QTS cannot be lost or affected by the length of time it takes them
to complete induction.
. [[para-1-11]] There is no legal requirement to satisfactorily complete an induction
period if an ECT intends to work solely in the independent sector, an
academy, a free school, a BSO, an independent nursery school or an FE
institution. However, it may be possible for an ECT to serve a statutory
induction period in such settings as set out in this guidance.

=== Exemptions to the requirement to serve an induction period

[arabic, start=12]
. [[para-1-12]] <<_annex_a_exemptions,Annex A>> provides information on those categories of qualified teachers
who are exempt from the requirement to satisfactorily complete a
statutory induction period in order to be employed as a teacher in a
relevant school.

=== Early career teachers may only serve one induction period

[arabic, start=13]
. [[para-1-13]] An ECT has only one chance to complete statutory induction. An ECT who
has completed induction and is judged to have failed to meet the
Teachers’ Standards at the end of their induction period, is not
permitted to repeat induction (although they may appeal against the
decision: see paras <<para-4-9,4.9>>–<<para-4-10,4.10>>). While such an ECT does not lose their
QTS, they cannot be employed lawfully as a teacher in a relevant school,
including any post where they would carry out specified work. Their name
is included on the list of persons, held by the Teaching Regulation
Agency, who have failed to satisfactorily complete an induction period.

== Section 2: The induction process

=== Institutions in which induction may be served

[arabic]
. [[para-2-1]] The 2012 Regulations specify that induction can be served in the
following institutions:

* a relevant school in England – this includes: a maintained school; a
non- maintained special school; a maintained nursery school; a nursery
school that forms part of a maintained school; a local authority
maintained children’s centre; and a pupil referral unit (PRU)
* a non-maintained nursery school
* an independent school in England; academies; free schools; 16–19
academies; alternative provision academies; and city technology colleges
or an independent nursery school subject to the circumstances set out in
para <<para-2-4,2.4>>footnote:[Independent schools, academies, free schools, and
British schools overseas are not required to offer statutory induction
to their ECTs, but if they choose to do so must adhere to the 2012
Regulations and have regard to the statutory guidance.]
* a further education (FE) institution, including a sixth-form college,
in the circumstances set out in para <<para-2-3,2.3>>
* an independent school overseas which:
** has been inspected by a DfE-accredited inspectorate within the last
six years against the Standards for Inspection of British Schools
Overseas; and
** has satisfactorily met all of those standards/categories; and
** is a member of an organisation which the DfE has determined may
represent such schools
* a school or FE institution in Wales in which an induction period may
be served under Welsh regulations.

=== Induction in a maintained, non-maintained or independent nursery school, or maintained children’s centre

[arabic, start=2]
. [[para-2-2]] ECTs employed and completing a period or part-period of statutory
induction in these settings must have a headteacher/principal who can
make the recommendation against the Teachers’ Standards and should teach
classes of pupils predominantly aged three and over. The
headteacher/principal should ensure that the ECT’s post is suitable for
induction (see paras <<para-2-18,2.18>>–<<para-2-19,2.19>>).

=== Induction in further education institutions (including sixth-form colleges and 16-19 academies)

[arabic, start=3]
. [[para-2-3]] An FE institution, sixth-form college or 16–19 academy wishing to
offer an ECT a post in which to serve a statutory induction period is
expected to:

* ensure that normally no more than 10% of the ECT’s teaching in the FE
institution is devoted to teaching classes predominantly consisting of
pupils aged 19 and over;
* enable the ECT to develop a sound knowledge and understanding of
day-today practices and the role of a teacher in a school; ECTs should
spend the equivalent of at least ten days teaching children of
compulsory school age in a school during their induction; and
* make every effort to provide the ECT with up to a further 15 days’
experience in a school setting.

=== Institutions where induction cannot be served

[arabic, start=4]
. [[para-2-4]] Workplaces which cannot offer statutory induction are:

* a school requiring special measures (i.e. one which is eligible for
intervention under section 62 of the Education and Inspections Act
2006), except in cases where Ofsted have judged a school, or part of a
school, to be suitable to host induction (see paras <<para-2-5,2.5>>–<<para-2-6,2.6>>)
* an FE institution where, following an Ofsted inspection, it is
reported that the overall effectiveness of the institution, or part of
its education or training, has been judged to be inadequate (category 4)
except in cases where Ofsted has judged the institution or part of the
institution to be suitable to host induction (see para <<para-2-7,2.7>>)

=== Where induction may be served or continued in a maintained school in special measures or an FE institution which has been judged inadequate

[arabic, start=5]
. [[para-2-5]] Relevant schools and academies can continue to host induction where a
teacher was employed on an employment-based initial teacher training
scheme in the school prior to gaining QTS, or had already started an
induction period in the setting, before it entered special measures.
. [[para-2-6]] Generally, once a setting has entered special measures it is not
permitted to recruit any new ECTs. However, an Ofsted Inspector may make
a judgement on whether the setting is suitable for the purposes of
induction. In some cases, particularly with larger schools, Ofsted may
give permission for ECT appointments within specific departments or
subject departments of the school.
. [[para-2-7]] ECTs already serving induction in an FE institution where the overall
effectiveness of the institution, or part of its education and training,
have been judged to be inadequate (category 4) at the time of
inspection, can continue to serve induction. FE institutions judged as
inadequate, or where leadership and management is judged inadequate,
should have a certification in writing from the Chief Inspector that the
institution, or the part of such an institution in which the person in
question teaches, is fit for the purpose of providing supervision and
training during an induction period.
. [[para-2-8]] In all cases, the appropriate body should be satisfied that such
circumstances will not unfairly compromise the ECT’s ability to complete
induction successfully.

=== Checking a teacher is eligible to start an induction period

[arabic, start=9]
. [[para-2-9]] Before the ECT takes up post the headteacher/principal must undertake
pre-employment checks, which must be verified by the appropriate body
upon registration (see para <<para-2-10,2.10>>).

=== Qualified teacher status

[arabic, start=10]
. [[para-2-10]] An ECT cannot undertake statutory induction (or a period of employment
counting towards induction) unless they have been awarded QTS.
Headteachers/principals and appropriate bodies must check with the
Teaching Regulation Agency that the individual holds QTS.

=== Start date for induction

[arabic, start=11]
. [[para-2-11]] The ECT must be registered with an appropriate body before the start
of the induction (see para <<para-2-27,2.27>>).
. [[para-2-12]] The start date for induction will be determined by the appropriate
body and should be agreed in advance with the headteacher/principal and
ECT.
. [[para-2-13]] The start date for induction should be the date when the ECT’s
induction programme formally commences. This may be a different date
from when the ECT’s contract starts.

=== Eligibility to carry out short-term (less than one term) supply teaching

[arabic, start=14]
. [[para-2-14]] A qualified teacher who gained QTS and who has not completed an
induction period, can undertake short-term supply work of less than one
term in a relevant school for a maximum period of 5 years from the point
of award of QTS. This is a fixed time limit with no discretion to
extend. Short-term supply placements of less than one term, or
equivalent, cannot count towards induction, as such posts will not
provide an ECT with the breadth of experience, support, and assessment
necessary to enable them to demonstrate that their performance against
the Teachers’ Standards is satisfactory (see paras <<para-1-9,1.9>> and <<para-2-18,2.18>>–<<para-2-19,2.19>>).
. [[para-2-15]] The headteacher/principal or supply agency is responsible for ensuring
that a teacher who has not satisfactorily completed an induction period
is eligible to carry out short-term supply work.
. [[para-2-16]] It is not possible to backdate the start of an induction period if a
short-term supply contract is extended so that it lasts for one term or
longer. However, an induction programme must be put in place immediately
if it becomes clear that the extended contract will continue for at
least a term.
. [[para-2-17]] An ECT can work part-time as a short-term supply teacher, while
concurrently serving induction in another part-time post after the
five-year limit has expired. However, the short-term supply post will
not count towards induction.

=== A suitable post for induction

[arabic, start=18]
. [[para-2-18]] In order for the ECT to serve induction the headteacher/principal and
appropriate body must first agree that the post is suitable for this
purpose. The headteacher/principal of the institution in which an ECT is
serving an induction period, and the appropriate body, are jointly
responsible for ensuring that the supervision and training of the ECT
meets their development needs. The duties assigned to the ECT, and the
conditions under which they work, should be such as to facilitate a fair
and effective assessment of the ECT’s conduct and efficiency as a
teacher against the Teachers’ Standards. A suitable post is expected to:

* have a headteacher/principal in post who is able to make a
recommendation about whether the ECT’s performance against the Teachers’
Standards is satisfactory;
* have prior agreement with an appropriate body to act in this role to
quality assure the induction process;
* provide the ECT with an ECF-based induction programme;
* provide the ECT with the necessary employment tasks and experience of
teaching whole classes, as well as with the necessary support to enable
them to demonstrate satisfactory performance against the Teachers’
Standards throughout and by the end of the induction period;
* include the appointment of an induction tutor who is expected to hold
QTS;
* include the appointment of a designated mentor who is expected to hold
QTS;
* provide the ECT with a reduced timetable to enable them to undertake
activities in their induction programme (see paras <<para-2-20,2.20>>-<<para-2-21,2.21>>);
* not make unreasonable demands upon the ECT;
* not normally demand teaching outside the age range and/or subject(s)
for which the ECT has been employed to teach;
* not present the ECT, on a day-to-day basis, with discipline problems
that are unreasonably demanding for the setting;
* involve the ECT regularly teaching the same class(es);
* involve similar planning, teaching and assessment processes to those
in which other teachers working in similar substantive posts in the
institution are engaged in; and
* not involve additional non-teaching responsibilities without the
provision of appropriate preparation and support (see para <<para-2-39,2.39>>).

. [[para-2-19]] In addition, the governing body must be satisfied that the institution
has the capacity to support the ECT and that the headteacher/principal
is fulfilling their responsibilities.

=== Ensuring a reduced timetable 

[arabic, start=20]
. [[para-2-20]] In a relevant school, the headteacher/principal must ensure that the
ECT has a reduced timetable. In the first year (terms 1-3, or equivalent
for part-time ECTs) of induction an ECT must not teach more than 90% of
the timetable of the school’s existing teachers on the main pay range
and in the second year (terms 4-6, or equivalent for part-time ECTs) of
induction must not teach more than 95%. This time off timetable should
be used to specifically enable ECTs to undertake activities in their
induction programme.
. [[para-2-21]] This is in addition to the timetable reduction in respect of planning,
preparation and assessment time (PPA) that all teachers receive. ECTs in
independent schools, academies and free schools, BSOs, independent
nursery schools and FE colleges must also have a reduced timetable on a
comparable basis.

=== Determining the appropriate body

[arabic, start=22]
. [[para-2-22]] Independent quality assurance of statutory induction, through the role
of the appropriate body, is important both for ensuring that schools
provide adequate support for their ECTs, and that their assessment is
fair and consistent across all institutions.
. [[para-2-23]] An ECT cannot start their induction until their appropriate body has
been agreed. In the absence of another body acting as appropriate body
for a school, the teaching school hub for the area in which the school
is situated should be asked to be the appropriate body for that school.
. [[para-2-24]] The following organisations can act as the appropriate body:

* A teaching school hub (subject to the conditions outlined in para <<para-2-25,2.25>>
below)
* A local authority with which the school reaches agreement (From 1
September 2023 local authorities will no longer be listed as an
appropriate body). From 1 September 2023 until 31 August 2024, local
authorities can only continue to act as appropriate bodies in a limited
capacity where the local authority was acting as an appropriate body for
an institution immediately before 1 September 2023 for an ECT who was
serving an induction period in that same institution immediately before
1 September 2023.
+
In addition to the above list, an appropriate body may also be an
organisation determined for this purpose by the Secretary of State.
These organisations currently are:

* National Teacher Accreditation (NTA) (From 1 September 2024 NTA will
no longer operate as an appropriate body)
* The Independent https://istip.co.uk/:[Schools Teacher Induction Panel] (ISTIP) (for their
members and associate or additional members only)
* https://www.espeducation.co.uk/:[Educational Success Partners] (ESP) (From August 2024, for British
Schools Overseas (BSOs) eligible to offer induction under paragraph <<para-2-1,2.1>>)

=== Conditions for teaching school hubs carrying out the appropriate body role

[arabic, start=25]
. [[para-2-25]] Teaching school hubs acting as appropriate bodies are subject to the
following conditions:

* A teaching school hub that is an accredited ITT provider cannot be the
appropriate body for an ECT for whom it recommended that the award of
QTS should be made; and
* A teaching school hub cannot be the appropriate body for an ECT whom
it employs, or who has served any part of their induction at that
school.

=== Charging by the appropriate body

[arabic, start=26]
. [[para-2-26]] The appropriate body may make reasonable charges (agreed in advance),
not exceeding the cost of supplying the service as follows:

* To any maintained school or institution
* To an independent school; an academy; a free school; a city technology
college; a BSO; an independent nursery school; or a further education
institution to which it is supplying the service

=== Registering the ECT with the appropriate body

[arabic, start=27]
. [[para-2-27]] Once an ECT has been appointed, the headteacher/principal must notify
the appropriate body in advance of the ECT taking up post. Failure to do
so may delay the start of the induction period.

=== Named contact at the appropriate body 

[arabic, start=28]
. [[para-2-28]] At registration, the appropriate body should provide the ECT with a
named contact with whom they may raise any concerns about their
induction programme that they are unable to resolve. This person should
not be directly involved in monitoring or supporting the ECT or in
making decisions about satisfactory completion of induction.

=== Informing the Teaching Regulation Agency of ECT appointments

[arabic, start=29]
. [[para-2-29]] Appropriate bodies should inform the Teaching Regulation Agency of any
ECTs who start an induction period or who have taken up a post in which
to continue their induction.

=== Determining the length of the induction period

[arabic, start=30]
. [[para-2-30]] The length of the induction period an ECT is required to serve,
whether the teaching post in which they are doing so is part-time or
full-time, is the full-time equivalent of two school years. This usually
consists of six school terms, divided into two periods each consisting
of three school terms (see para <<para-2-36,2.36>>).
. [[para-2-31]] The appropriate body makes the final decision about the equivalence to
two school years in cases where the ECT serves induction in more than
one setting or in non-standard settings such as those in the FE sector.
. [[para-2-32]] In some exceptional circumstances the length of an induction period
may be reduced. For further details see <<_section_3_special_circumstances,Section 3: Special Circumstances>>.

=== Minimum period of continuous employment that can count towards induction 

[arabic, start=33]
. [[para-2-33]] The minimum period that will need to be counted towards completion of
the induction period (for both full-time and part-time ECTs) is
continuous employment equivalent to one term (based on an institution
that operates three terms in a school year). This applies to both
permanent and long-term supply teaching posts. So for part time ECTs the
minimum period of one term only requires the ECT to be in employment for
one term. They do not have to undertake induction equivalent to one full
term to fulfil the minimum period over a longer period of time.
. [[para-2-34]] The minimum period of one term reflects the need for each ECT to work
in a stable environment and receive a supported and pre-planned
induction programme. In addition, it is important that the ECT is in
post long enough to be able to receive sufficient monitoring and
feedback and prepare for a fair and reasonable assessment of their
performance. It would be very difficult to do this against all of the
Teachers’ Standards over a period of less than one term. After the
minimum period has been served, any continuous employment of any length
of time will count towards the 2 year induction period on the ECT’s
records. Therefore if a full time ECT ends a contract of employment
after serving 2.5 terms, their recordsfootnote:[Please note that TRA
records only record full terms. Local records held by the ECT’s
school/institution and the appropriate body should record the exact
length of induction served.] (and interim assessment) should show that
they have completed 2.5 terms and they will be expected to complete a
further 3.5 terms when they resume induction. And if a part time ECT
working 0.5 FTE ends a contract of employment after 2.5 terms, their
records (and interim assessment) would show that they have completed
1.25 terms and would be expected to resume induction from that point
(although this should be read in conjunction with guidance around
reductions to induction periods available for part time ECTs – please
see <<_section_3_special_circumstances,Section 3>>).
. [[para-2-35]] For ECTs who are not employed to work within a term structure (for
example those teaching certain apprenticeship courses in an FE
institution) the appropriate body should decide the minimum period of
employment that can count towards induction, taking into account para
<<para-2-33,2.33>> above.

=== Length of the induction period for an ECT who works part-time

[arabic, start=36]
. [[para-2-36]] ECTs serving induction on a part-time basis at any point will need to
serve the full-time equivalent (FTE) of two full school years (based on
a school year of three terms). Therefore, an ECT working part-time as a
<<para-0-5,0.5>> FTE will need to serve induction for four school years.
. [[para-2-37]] It is for the headteacher/principal and appropriate body to decide in
each individual case the length of the induction period required which
is fair and takes full account of the ECT’s working pattern.
. [[para-2-38]] In cases where part-time ECTs have completed a period covering but not
equivalent to a minimum of two full school years and can demonstrate
that they meet the Teachers’ Standards they may, taking into account
para <<para-2-37,2.37>> above, be able to have their induction period reduced (see
para <<para-3-5,3.5>> on reductions).

=== Monitoring, support and assessment during induction

[arabic, start=39]
. [[para-2-39]] A suitable monitoring and support programme must be put in place for
the ECT, structured to meet their professional development needs
(including the development needs of part-time ECTs). This is expected to
include:

* a programme of training that supports the ECT to understand and apply
the knowledge and skills set out in the Early Career Framework’s
evidence (‘learn that’) statements and practice (‘learn how to’)
statements;
* regular one to one mentoring sessions from a designated mentor who is
expected to hold QTS and has the time and ability to carry out the role
effectively;
* support and guidance from a designated induction tutor who is expected
to hold QTS and has the time and ability to carry out the role
effectively;
* observation of the ECT’s teaching with written feedback provided;
* professional reviews of progress conducted by the induction tutor to
set and review development targets against the Teachers’ Standards; and
* ECT’s observation of experienced teachers either in the ECT’s own
institution or in another institution where effective practice has been
identified.

=== Early Career Framework based training

[arabic, start=40]
. [[para-2-40]] The headteacher is expected to ensure that ECTs receive a programme of
training that enables the ECT to understand and apply the knowledge and
skills set out in each of the ECF evidence (‘learn that’) statements and
practice (‘learn how to’) statements. Early Career Framework-based
training is expected to be embedded as a central aspect of induction; it
is not an additional training programme.
. [[para-2-41]] There are three approaches schools can choose from to enable the
delivery of an ECF based induction. It is up to the headteacher to
choose the approach that best suits the needs of their ECTs and mentors.
The three approaches are:

* *A funded provider-led programme* - Schools can choose to work with
providers accredited by the Department for Education who will design and
deliver a programme of face-to-face and online training to ECTs and
their mentors. This programme is funded by the Department for Education.
* *Schools deliver their own training using DfE accredited materials and
resources* - Schools use freely available DfE accredited
materialsfootnote:[Materials available at:
https://support-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/], which
includes ready to use materials and resources for new teachers and
mentors, to deliver their own ECT and mentor support. These materials
have been accredited by the Department for Education and quality assured
by the Education Endowment Foundation.
* *Schools design and deliver their own two-year induction programme for
ECTs based on the ECF.*

=== Appointment of an Induction Tutor

[arabic, start=42]
. [[para-2-42]] The headteacher/principal should identify a person to act as the ECT’s
induction tutor, to provide regular monitoring and support, and
coordination of assessment. The induction tutor is expected to hold QTS
and have the necessary skills and knowledge to work successfully in this
role and be able to assess the ECT’s progress against the Teachers’
Standards. This is a very important element of the induction process and
the induction tutor must be given sufficient time to carry out the role
effectively and to meet the needs of the ECT. The induction tutor will
need to be able to make rigorous and fair judgements about the ECT’s
progress in relation to the Teachers’ Standards. They will need to be
able to recognise when early action is needed in the case of an ECT who
is experiencing difficulties. It may, in some circumstances, be
appropriate for the headteacher/principal to be the induction tutor. The
induction tutor is a separate role to that of mentor (see para <<para-2-45,2.45>>).

=== Appointment of a mentor 

[arabic, start=43]
. [[para-2-43]] The headteacher/principal should identify a person to act as the ECT’s
mentor, to provide regular mentoring. The mentor is expected to hold QTS
and have the necessary skills and knowledge to work successfully in this
role. Where possible, this includes having the skills and experience to
provide mentoring for the specific subject and/or phase of their ECT.
Mentoring is a very important element of the induction process and the
mentor is expected to be given adequate time to carry out the role
effectively and to meet the needs of the ECT. This includes attending
regular mentoring sessions and mentor training where appropriate.
. [[para-2-44]] ECT and mentor sessions are expected to be timetabled during teaching
hours as schools are funded to cover the time off timetable. The
headteacher/principal and appropriate body are expected to ensure that
mentors are given sufficient time to carry out the role effectively and
meet the needs of their ECTs. In exceptional circumstances where schools
require flexibility due to timetabling constraints, mentoring may take
place outside of teaching hours but should always be scheduled within
contracted time.
. [[para-2-45]] The mentor and the induction tutor are two discrete roles with
differing responsibilities and it is expected that these roles should be
held by different individuals. In exceptional circumstances it may be
necessary for the headteacher to designate a single teacher to fulfil
both roles, which may be the headteacher/principal themselves. Where
this is the case the headteacher should ensure that the induction tutor
understands that they are fulfilling two discrete roles and that
adequate safeguards are put in place to ensure that the mentoring
support offered to the ECT is not conflated with assessment of the ECT
against the Teachers’ Standards.

=== Observation of the ECT’s teaching practice

[arabic, start=46]
. [[para-2-46]] An ECT’s teaching is expected to be observed at regular intervals
throughout their induction period to facilitate a fair and effective
assessment of the ECT’s teaching practice, conduct and efficiency
against the Teachers’ Standards. Observations of the ECT may be
undertaken by the induction tutor or another suitable person from inside
or outside the institution.
. [[para-2-47]] It is also expected that:

* the observer holds QTS;
* the ECT and the observer meet to review any teaching that has been
observed, with arrangements for post-observation review meetings made in
advance;
* feedback from the observation is provided in a prompt manner and is
constructive, with a brief written record made on each occasion; and
* any written record will indicate where any development needs have been
identified.

=== Professional progress reviews of the ECT

[arabic, start=48]
. [[para-2-48]] ECTs undertaking induction are exempt from appraisalfootnote:[As set
out in regulation
https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/115/regulation/1/made[1(4)(a)]
of the Education (School Teachers’ Appraisal) (England) Regulations 2012
(the Appraisal Regulations)].The induction tutor is expected to review
the ECT’s progress against the Teachers’ Standards throughout the
induction period, with progress reviews taking place in each term where
a formal assessment (see paras <<para-2-55,2.55>>–<<para-2-61,2.61>>) is not scheduled. For ECTs
serving induction on a part-time basis this means progress reviews are
also expected to take place each term (based on an institution that
operates three terms in a school year), regardless of their working
patterns. This is to ensure that part time ECTs on low FTE still receive
regular reviews of their progress against the standards and that support
is put in place early where unsatisfactory progress occurs.
. [[para-2-49]] When scheduling or requesting progress reviews, induction tutors and
appropriate bodies are expected to consider:

* When in the term an ECT started their induction. An ECT who joined
halfway through term one is expected to have a progress review by
halfway through term two (this applies to both full-time and part-time
ECTs).
* Where, due to part-time working patterns, a progress review and formal
assessment fall within a period of less than one term. In these
circumstances the ECT should only be required to do the formal
assessment.
* Where an ECT is absent at the point a progress review is scheduled. In
these circumstances, any outstanding progress review is expected to be
rescheduled when the ECT returns.
[arabic]
. [[para-2-50]] Progress reviews are expected to be informed by existing evidence of
the ECT’s teaching and to be conducted with sufficient detail to ensure
that there is nothing unexpected for the ECT when it comes to their
formal assessment.
. [[para-2-51]] Progress reviews are not formal assessments and there is no
requirement for ECTs to create evidence specifically to inform a
progress review. ECTs are expected, nonetheless, to engage with the
process and provide copies of existing evidence as agreed with the
induction tutor.
. [[para-2-52]] A written record of each progress review is expected to be retained
and provided to the ECT after each meeting, with the record clearly
stating whether the ECT is on track to successfully complete induction,
briefly summarising evidence collected by the induction tutor and
stating the agreed development targets. It is also expected that
objectives are reviewed and revised in relation to the Teachers’
Standards and the needs and strengths of the individual ECT.
. [[para-2-53]] Where the induction tutor is not the headteacher, it is expected that
they also update the headteacher on the ECT’s progress after each
progress review.
. [[para-2-54]] It is expected that the induction tutor notifies the appropriate body
and ECT after each progress review stating whether the ECT is making
satisfactory progress. Where the induction tutor believes the ECT is not
making satisfactory progress (see para <<para-4-1,4.1>>) it is expected they outline
the plan they have put in place to assist the ECT in getting back on
track. It is expected that schools maintain regular contact with the
appropriate body throughout induction, keeping them apprised of the
ECT’s progress and providing them with copies of all progress reviews.

=== Formal assessments

[arabic, start=55]
. [[para-2-55]] ECTs should have formal assessments carried out by either the
headteacher/principal or the induction tutor. Mentors should not carry
out formal assessments unless they are also acting as the induction
tutor (see <<_section_5_roles_and_responsibilities,Section 5>> for further information about roles and
responsibilities). ECTs should receive an assessment in the final term
of the first year (term 3 or equivalent for part-time ECTs) and in the
final term of the second year of induction (term 6 or equivalent for
part-time ECTs). It is for institutions and ECTs to agree exactly when
the assessment dates are set. Evidence used in assessments should be
clear and transparent and copies of the assessment reports should be
provided to the ECT and appropriate body.
. [[para-2-56]] Where an ECT is absent at the point a formal assessment is scheduled,
any outstanding formal assessment should not be made until the ECT
returns.
. [[para-2-57]] Evidence for assessments must be drawn from the ECT’s work as a
teacher during their induction. To ensure evidence gathering is not
burdensome for the ECT, formal assessment meetings should be informed by
evidence gathered during progress reviews and assessment periods leading
up to the formal assessment. This will consist of existing documents and
working documents. There is no need for the ECT to create anything new
for the formal assessment, they should draw from their work as a teacher
and from their induction programme. Judgements made during the induction
period should relate directly to the Teachers’ Standards and should not
be made against the ECF (see para <<para-1-9,1.9>>).
. [[para-2-58]] ECTs should be kept up to date on their progress. *There should be
nothing unexpected.*
. [[para-2-59]] Formal assessment reports should be completed for both formal
assessments. These reports should clearly show assessment of the ECT’s
performance against the Teachers’ Standards at the time of the
assessment.
. [[para-2-60]] The final assessment meeting is at the end of the induction period,
and will form the basis of the headteacher’s/principal’s recommendation
to the appropriate body as to whether, having completed their induction
period, the ECT’s performance against the Teachers’ Standards is
satisfactory, unsatisfactory, or whether or not an extension should be
considered. This recommendation should be recorded on the final
assessment report.
. [[para-2-61]] Once assessment reports have been completed, the ECT should add their
comments. They should then be signed by the induction tutor,
headteacher/principal and the ECT. Once signed, the ECT should be given
the original and a copy sent to the appropriate body shortly after each
meeting, and within 10 working days of the final assessment meeting.
These may be submitted electronically.

=== Interim assessments

[arabic, start=62]
. [[para-2-62]] When an ECT leaves a post after completing one term or more in an
institution but before the next formal assessment would take place, the
induction tutor or headteacher/principal is expected to complete an
interim assessment. This is expected to take place before the ECT leaves
their post to ensure that the ECT’s progress, performance, the length of
induction completed and the number of days absent since the last
assessment are captured. This is especially important where concerns
about progress may have arisen. The information recorded on the interim
assessment report will help to ensure that induction can be continued
effectively in any subsequent post. This is also required if the ECT
leaves during their final term of induction.
. [[para-2-63]] In exceptional circumstances where an interim assessment cannot be
completed before the ECT leaves post (for example, in situations where
an absent ECT subsequently leaves their post without returning) the
induction tutor or headteacher/principal is still expected to complete
an interim assessment report and provide a copy to the appropriate body
and the ECT.

=== Raising concerns

[arabic, start=64]
. [[para-2-64]] An ECT is normally expected to raise any concerns about their
induction programme with their induction tutor in the first instance. If
the matter is not resolved, the ECT may notify the named contact at the
appropriate body (see para <<para-2-28,2.28>>) who should, as soon as possible,
investigate the issues raised.

=== Completing the induction period 

[arabic, start=65]
. [[para-2-65]] An ECT completes their induction period when they have served:

* the full-time equivalent of two standard school years (usually six
terms, based on a school year of three terms); or
* a reduced period of a minimum of one term (as agreed with the
appropriate body) based on previous teaching experience (see paras <<para-3-2,3.2>>–
<<para-3-4,3.4>>); or
* a reduced period of induction for part time teachers covering but not
equivalent to a minimum of two years (as agreed with the appropriate
body) (see para <<para-3-5,3.5>>); or
* an extension to that period, as a consequence of absences occurring
during the period.
[arabic]
. [[para-2-66]] The appropriate body makes the final decision as to whether an ECT’s
performance against the Teachers’ Standards is satisfactory, drawing on
the recommendation of the headteacher/principal.
. [[para-2-67]] Within 20 working days of receiving the headteacher’s/principal’s
recommendation, the appropriate body must decide whether the ECT:

* has performed satisfactorily against the Teachers’ Standards and
thereby satisfactorily completed their induction period;
* requires an extension of the induction period; or
* has failed to satisfactorily complete the induction period.
[arabic]
. [[para-2-68]] In making this decision the appropriate body must take into account
the headteacher’s/principal’s recommendation and all available evidence
including any written representations from the ECT.
. [[para-2-69]] The appropriate body must, within three working days of making the
decision, make written notification of the decision to: the ECT; the
headteacher/principal (in whose institution the ECT was working at the
end of their induction); and the employer (if other than the appropriate
body itself). They must also notify the Teaching Regulation Agency and
should do so within three working days in the case of decisions to fail
or extend the ECT’s induction, and via the termly return for other
notifications.
. [[para-2-70]] If the appropriate body decides to extend the period of induction or
that the ECT has failed to complete their induction period
satisfactorily, they must inform the ECT of their right to appeal
against this decision, with the name and address of the Appeals Body
(the Teaching Regulation Agency), and the deadline for submitting an
appeal. The ECT must notify the Teaching Regulation Agency that they
wish to appeal the decision within 20 working days, after which the
right of appeal expires except in exceptional circumstances.
. [[para-2-71]] Failure to complete the induction period satisfactorily means that the
ECT is no longer eligible to be employed as a teacher in a maintained
school, a maintained nursery school, a non-maintained special school or
a pupil referral unit. However, this does not prevent them from teaching
in other settings where statutory induction is not mandatory.
. [[para-2-72]] An ECT working in a relevant school who has failed induction must be
dismissed within ten working days of them giving notice that they do not
intend to exercise their right to appeal, or from when the time limit
for making an appeal expires without an appeal being brought. If the
ECT’s appeal is heard, and they have been judged as having failed
induction, the employer should dismiss the ECT within ten working days
of being told of the outcome of the hearing.
. [[para-2-73]] The Teaching Regulation Agency must ensure that the name of the person
who has failed induction is included on the list of persons who have
failed to satisfactorily complete an induction period and notify them of
their inclusion. This must only be done once the time limit for making
an appeal against the decision has expired or following dismissal of
such an appeal.

=== Record keeping/retention

[arabic, start=74]
. [[para-2-74]] The appropriate body is responsible for keeping a record of each ECT
it has registered for induction. It should also monitor the return of
progress review outcomes and assessment reports and contact the
institution concerned when these documents have not been submitted or
signed on time. Records should state the date an ECT starts a period of
employment counting towards induction, how much of the period has been
completed, changes in working patterns and any absences. These should be
noted when submitting progress review records and on assessment reports
at the end of each formal assessment period (see paras <<para-2-48,2.48>>-<<para-2-61,2.61>>). The
headteacher/principal should notify the appropriate body if an ECT
leaves the institution before completing the period. The appropriate
body will then notify the Teaching Regulation Agency.
. [[para-2-75]] Where an ECT has already completed part of their induction period in
another institution, the headteacher/principal should contact the ECT’s
previous appropriate body to obtain copies of any progress review
records or assessment reports (including any interim assessments). They
should establish how much induction time remains to be served and alert
the ECT’s current appropriate body to any concerns that have been raised
about the ECT’s progress by previous employers. The current appropriate
body is expected to ensure that the headteacher/principal has contacted
the ECT’s previous appropriate body and has obtained the necessary
reports to ensure induction can be continued effectively. Where agreed
with the headteacher/principal the current appropriate body may contact
the ECT’s previous appropriate body to obtain the necessary reports.
. [[para-2-76]] The Teaching Regulation Agency keeps records of teachers who have
completed or part-completed induction. Details of teachers who have
passed or failed induction are available to employers through the
https://www.gov.uk/guidance/teacher-status-checks-information-for-employers[Employer
Access Online service.] As the Appeals Body, the Teaching Regulation
Agency also keeps records of all appeals.
. [[para-2-77]] It is recommended that assessment reports are retained by both the
institution and the appropriate body for a minimum of six years. If
there are reasons for the institution and the appropriate body to retain
records for longer than six years, they may do so as long as they comply
with the Data Protection Act. ECTs are advised to retain the original
copies of their own assessment reports.

=== Confidentiality and data protection 

[arabic, start=78]
. [[para-2-78]] Headteachers/principals, induction tutors, appropriate bodies and the
Teaching Regulation Agency should ensure that arrangements are in place
to facilitate the effective protection and secure transfer of data.
. [[para-2-79]] The induction process and the assessments generated from it should be
treated with confidentiality at all times and should not be shared with
anyone not directly involved in the induction process. It should be made
clear to anyone viewing such documents that they are confidential and
ECTs must be made aware of who has been granted access to their
assessments.
. [[para-2-80]] The governing body can request general reports on the progress of an
ECT on a termly basis but are not automatically entitled to have access
to an individual’s assessment reports. The exception to this would be
when an ECT has raised concerns about a particular issue/assessment via
the institution’s grievance procedures, which would in many cases
require the governing body to investigate the situation. If at any stage
the governing body has questions or concerns about the quality of the
institution’s induction arrangements and the roles and responsibilities
of staff involved in the process, they can seek guidance from the
appropriate body.

== Section 3: Special circumstances

[arabic]
. [[para-3-1]] This section explains the regulations that apply on a less regular
basis. It covers:

* reducing an induction period in recognition of previous teaching
experience and exceptional circumstances;
* extending an induction period;
* short-term supply teaching and ECTs;
* ECTs employed simultaneously in two or more institutions;
* determining completion of induction in the event of loss of
data/incorrect data; and
* special provisions applying to a qualified teacher who has not passed
the numeracy skills test on completion of the induction period (Cohort
1).

=== Reducing the induction period 

[arabic, start=2]
. [[para-3-2]] Even though some teachers already have significant teaching experience
when they enter the maintained sector for the first time, they are still
required to serve statutory induction. In such cases, appropriate bodies
have discretion to reduce the length of the induction period to a
minimum of one term (based on a school year of three terms) to recognise
this experience. An appropriate body in England has the discretion to
consider reducing the 2 year length of the Induction period being served
under the English legal framework (the 2012 regulations) in recognition
of part of an induction served in Wales under the Welsh induction
regulationsfootnote:[the https://www.legislation.gov.uk/wsi/2015/484/contents/made[[.underline]#Education
(Induction Arrangements for School Teachers) (Wales) Regulations
2015#] and
the https://www.legislation.gov.uk/wsi/2022/1058/contents/made[[.underline]#Education
(Induction Arrangements for School Teachers) (Wales) (Amendment)
Regulations 2022#]] subject to evidence of induction records.
. [[para-3-3]] In making such a decision they should take account of advice from the
headteacher/principal and must gain the agreement of the teacher
concerned. If a teacher wishes to serve the full induction period they
must be permitted to do so. The appropriate body may wish to consider
what evidence of previous experience and performance they require in
reaching their decision, including performance management documentation
from previous teaching employment. Reductions should only be considered
where an ECT has extensive prior experience of teaching whole-classes to
the Teachers’ Standards. Examples of when this discretion might be
considered appropriate include a teacher who has taught in the
independent sector or who has gained QTS via the assessment-only
routefootnote:[The assessment-only route to QTS allows an individual
with a degree to demonstrate that they already meet all the relevant
standards without the need for any further training by presenting
detailed evidence to an accredited and approved training provider and by
having their teaching assessed in a school.]. In all cases, if a reduced
induction is considered appropriate when determining the length by which
the induction is to be reduced appropriate bodies are expected to
consider the remaining progress that is to be made against the Teachers’
Standards.
. [[para-3-4]] Where the length of induction is reduced to one term, only the final
assessment meeting and report (see paras <<para-2-60,2.60>>–<<para-2-61,2.61>>) will be required
with the headteacher’s/principal’s recommendation on whether the
teacher’s performance against the Teachers’ Standards is satisfactory or
if an extension would be appropriate. The appropriate body will then
follow the induction process in the normal way (see paras <<para-2-65,2.65>>–<<para-2-73,2.73>>).
. [[para-3-5]] Separately, ECTs serving induction on a part-time basis may, on
completion of a minimum period covering but not equivalent to two full
years, be able to have their induction period reduced. After the minimum
period, at the point when enough evidence has been gathered that the
ECT’s performance against the Teachers’ Standards is satisfactory the
headteacher/principal may consult with the appropriate body on whether a
reduced induction is appropriate. It is for the appropriate body to
consider whether to grant a reduction and bring forward the final
assessment point. When considering whether to reduce a part-time ECT’s
induction, the appropriate body is expected to consult the
headteacher/principal and must gain the agreement of the teacher
concerned. A reduction, in these circumstances, should only be made on
the basis that the ECT has met the Teachers’ Standards.

=== Extending the induction period prior to completion to account for ad hoc absences

[arabic, start=6]
. [[para-3-6]] The induction period is automatically extended prior to completion
when an ECT’s absences per year of induction (or equivalent for
part-time teachers) total 30 days or more (with the exception of
statutory maternity leave, statutory paternity leave, shared parental
leave, statutory adoption leave, parental bereavement leave, or carer’s
leave (see para <<para-3-7,3.7>>). In these circumstances the relevant year of
induction must be extended by the aggregate total of days absent. If the
ECT is unable to serve the extension in the same school/institution, the
minimum period of employment of one term or equivalent must be served in
a new school/institution.

=== Extension of the induction period prior to completion due to statutory maternity, paternity, adoption, shared parental, parental bereavement or carer’s leave

[arabic, start=7]
. [[para-3-7]] ECTs who take statutory maternity leave, statutory paternity leave,
statutory adoption leave, shared parental leave, parental bereavement
leave or carer’s leavefootnote:[As defined under the Carer’s Leave Act
2023, guidance: https://www.gov.uk/carers-leave[Unpaid carer’s leave -
GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)]] while serving their induction period or serving an
extension to their induction period may decide whether their induction
period should be extended (or further extended) to reflect the number of
days absent for this purpose. Any outstanding assessments should not be
made until the ECT returns to work and has had the opportunity to decide
whether to extend (or further extend) their induction period, and any
such request must be granted. If an ECT chooses not to extend (or
further extend) their induction period, their performance will still be
assessed against the Teachers’ Standards. It is, therefore, recommended
that an ECT in this situation seeks advice before making such a
decision.

=== Extension of the induction period after induction has concluded 

[arabic, start=8]
. [[para-3-8]] The appropriate body has the option, when making its decision at the
end of the induction period (see paras <<para-2-66,2.66>>–<<para-2-70,2.70>>), to extend the period
where this can be justified. It determines the length of the extension,
the procedure for assessments during it, and the recommendation at its
end. The appropriate body may decide to extend where there is
insufficient evidence on which a decision can be based or where it would
be unreasonable to expect the ECT to have demonstrated satisfactory
performance against the Teachers’ Standards for other reasons. These
might include:

* personal crises;
* illness;
* disability;
* issues around the support during induction; or
* where there is insufficient evidence within induction documentation
for a decision to be made about whether the ECT’s performance against
the standards is satisfactory.
[arabic]
. [[para-3-9]] An ECT may be unable to, or choose not to, serve an extension in the
same school/institution in which they completed their original induction
period. They will then need to find another post in which to complete
the extension to their induction period. In these circumstances the
minimum period of employment, of one term, must still be served as the
ECT will be working in a new institution.
. [[para-3-10]] If an ECT leaves an institution having started but before completing
their extension, the headteacher/principal should complete an interim
assessment report and notify the appropriate body.

=== Induction periods extended in Wales (before or after completion)

[arabic, start=11]
. [[para-3-11]] When an extension is granted under Welsh regulations and the ECT is
subsequently employed at an institution in England, the period is
treated as having been extended under English regulations. These ECTs
will be expected to complete the remainder of a two-year statutory
induction, unless they are eligible under transitional arrangements to
complete the remainder of their one-year induction (see paras <<para-1-4,1.4>>–<<para-1-8,1.8>>).

=== Data loss/error – determining whether induction has been satisfactorily completed

[arabic, start=12]
. [[para-3-12]] In exceptional circumstances, where records have either been lost or
are in error through no fault of the teacher concerned, the appropriate
body will decide whether the teacher can be deemed to be exempt from
induction on the basis that the teachers has met the Teachers’ Standards
(see para 24 of Schedule 1 of the 2012 Regulations). Each case must be
considered on its own merits.
. [[para-3-13]] The appropriate body will want to ensure that every avenue has been
explored to recover the missing data or identify an audit trail before
making such a decision. The appropriate body, in reaching its decision,
should consider the strength of evidence that an error has occurred or
that records are missing or lost. It should also take into account
evidence that the teacher has demonstrated they have performed
satisfactorily against the Teachers’ Standards on the basis of evidence
from the teacher’s previous performance management reviews, and where
appropriate, the most recent performance management review statements.
If in doubt, the appropriate body may wish to consider other options
such as a full or reduced period of induction.

=== ECTs completing induction in more than one institution simultaneously

[arabic, start=14]
. [[para-3-14]] In all cases where induction is served in more than one institution
simultaneously, one headteacher/principal acts as the lead
headteacher/principal. The lead headteacher/principal:

* Is expected to ensure that they are satisfied that all posts are
suitable for induction (see paras <<para-2-18,2.18>>–<<para-2-19,2.19>>), and provide a fair
opportunity for the ECT to demonstrate that they have performed
satisfactorily against all of the Teachers’ Standards by the end of the
induction period;
* is responsible for consulting with and gathering evidence from the
other headteachers/principals;
* should also, in the case of unattached
teachers[multiblock footnote omitted], where appropriate, consult the
Head of Servicefootnote:[The Head of Service is the person at the local
authority responsible for the line management of the ECT.] from the
local authority; and
* having coordinated the evidence, make the recommendation to the
appropriate body on whether the ECT has performed satisfactorily against
all of the Teachers’ Standards. Methods of sharing information and
gathering evidence for progress reviews, classroom observation and
formal assessments should be clear to all those involved in the process,
including the ECT.
[arabic]
. [[para-3-15]] In all cases where induction is served in more than one institution
simultaneously, it is essential that one appropriate body takes the lead
in making the decision, following the recommendation from the lead
headteacher/principal.
. [[para-3-16]] For ECTs serving induction in more than one institution
simultaneously, the separate contracts are added together to calculate
the number of days in which induction must be served, and recorded by
the lead headteacher/principal. Each separate contract of employment
must meet the minimum period criteria (see paras <<para-2-33,2.33>>–<<para-2-35,2.35>>).

=== Special provisions applying to teachers who gained QTS between 1 May 2000 and 30 April 2001 (Cohort 1)

[arabic, start=17]
. [[para-3-17]] Teachers who gained QTS in England between 1 May 2000 and 30 April
2001 are known as Cohort 1 teachers. Previously these teachers had to
additionally pass the numeracy skills test before they could complete
induction satisfactorily and be employed as a teacher in a relevant
school. This requirement was removed on 25 June 2020.
. [[para-3-18]] Cohort 1 teachers who have completed induction but did not pass a
numeracy skills test before 25 June 2020 may contact the appropriate
body, with any written representations or other evidence, who can decide
if they have satisfactorily completed other elements of their induction.
If they have not completed all other elements of the induction, they can
continue with their induction without the need to pass a numeracy skills
test.

== Section 4: Unsatisfactory progress and appeals

=== Putting in place additional monitoring and support

[arabic]
. [[para-4-1]] ECTs undertaking induction are exempt from appraisalfootnote:[As set
out in regulation
https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/115/regulation/1/made[1(4)(a)]
of the Education (School Teachers’ Appraisal) (England) Regulations 2012
(the Appraisal Regulations)]. Where the induction tutor determines
during the progress review that the ECT is not making satisfactory
progress against the Teachers’ Standards, they should state this clearly
within the progress review record and clearly outline the support plan
they have put in place to assist the ECT in getting back on track. The
induction tutor is expected to notify the appropriate body of this
determination and share both the progress review record and support plan
for the appropriate body to review.
. [[para-4-2]] If it becomes apparent that an ECT is not making satisfactory progress
in the first formal assessment, the appropriate body should be informed,
and the headteacher/principal should ensure that additional monitoring
and support measures are put in place immediately. It is important that
the ECT is made aware of where they need to improve their practice and
given every opportunity to raise their performance. The
headteacher/principal and the appropriate body should be satisfied that:

* areas in which improvement is needed have been correctly identified;
* appropriate objectives have been set to guide the ECT towards
satisfactory performance against the Teachers’ Standards; and
* an effective support programme is in place to help the ECT improve
their performance.
[arabic]
. [[para-4-3]] If the ECT’s progress is still unsatisfactory in subsequent progress
reviews following the first assessment point, induction tutors should
continue to deliver progress reviews as set out above, including
reviewing and revising the ECT’s objectives and support plan, linking
these with the Teachers’ Standards and sharing with the ECT, headteacher
and appropriate body.

=== Action if performance is still unsatisfactory

[arabic, start=4]
. [[para-4-4]] Where there are still concerns about the ECT’s progress between formal
assessment one and two the induction tutor should explain to the ECT the
consequences of failure to complete the induction period satisfactorily
and discuss fully with the ECT:

* the identified weaknesses;
* the agreed objectives previously set in relation to the requirements
for the satisfactory completion of induction, updating these as
necessary;
* details of additional monitoring and support put in place;
* the evidence used to inform the judgement; and
* details of the improvement plan for the next assessment period.
[arabic]
. [[para-4-5]] As with all progress reviews, the progress review record should
capture the ECT’s unsatisfactory performance against the Teachers’
Standards and be shared with the appropriate body alongside the
corresponding support plan.
. [[para-4-6]] The completion of the assessment report will reflect the current rate
of progress and brief details of the issues discussed.

=== Action in the event of serious capability problems

[arabic, start=7]
. [[para-4-7]] In a few particularly serious cases it may be necessary for an
employer to instigate capability procedures at a stage before the end of
the induction period, which may lead to dismissal before the end of the
induction period. If this is the case, for as long as the ECT remains at
the institution the induction process must continue in parallel with the
capability procedure. The appropriate body should be informed however it
is the employer that has a responsibility to manage its capability
procedures and decisions relating to the outcome of these. The role of
the appropriate body relates only to the ECT’s performance in relation
to induction.
. [[para-4-8]] Dismissal on the grounds of capability before the end of the induction
period does not prevent the ECT from completing induction at another
institution, as all ECTs must complete a full induction period before
they can be judged to have failed induction. Further guidance on
capability procedures can be found separately at:
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teacher-appraisal-and-capability-model-policy[Teacher
appraisal and capability: model policy - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)]

=== Making an appeal against a decision by the appropriate body

[arabic, start=9]
. [[para-4-9]] If an ECT fails induction, or has their induction extended, the
appropriate body must advise the ECT of their right to appeal, who to
appeal to, and the time limit for doing so. In England, the Appeals Body
is the Teaching Regulation Agency, which acts on behalf of the Secretary
of State. For induction completed in Wales, the Appeals Body is the
Education Workforce Council.
. [[para-4-10]] Further guidance about the appeals process is available at:
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/induction-appeals-procedures

== Section 5: Roles and responsibilities 

[arabic]
. [[para-5-1]] This section summarises the roles and responsibilities of those
involved in the induction process.

=== The ECT

[arabic, start=2]
. [[para-5-2]] The ECT is expected to:

* provide evidence that they have QTS and are eligible to start
induction;
* meet with their induction tutor to discuss and agree priorities for
their induction programme and keep these under review;
* agree with their induction tutor how best to use their reduced
timetable allowance and guarantee engagement with their ECF-based
induction programme;
* provide evidence of their progress against the Teachers’ Standards
(see para <<para-1-9,1.9>>);
* participate fully in the agreed monitoring and development programme;
* raise any concerns with their induction tutor as soon as practicable;
* consult their appropriate body named contact at an early stage if
there are, or may be, difficulties in resolving issues with their
tutor/within the institution;
* keep track of and participate fully in the scheduled classroom
observations, progress reviews and formal assessment meetings;
* agree with their induction tutor the start and end dates of the
induction period/part periods and the dates of any absences from work
during any period/part period; and
* retain copies of all assessment reports.

=== Headteachers and principals

[arabic, start=3]
. [[para-5-3]] The headteacher/principal is, along with the appropriate body, jointly
responsible for the monitoring, support and assessment of the ECT during
induction, and is expected to:

* check that the ECT has been awarded QTS;
* clarify whether the teacher needs to serve an induction period or is
exempt;
* agree, in advance of the ECT starting the induction programme, which
body will act as the appropriate body;
* notify the appropriate body when an ECT is taking up a post in which
they will be undertaking induction;
* ensure that the requirements for a suitable post for induction are
met;
* ensure the induction tutor has the ability and sufficient time to
carry out their role effectively;
* ensure that the mentor has the ability and sufficient time to carry
out their role effectively;
* ensure an appropriate ECF-based induction programme is in place;
* ensure the ECT’s progress is reviewed regularly, including through
observations of and feedback on their teaching and that progress reviews
are sent to the appropriate body;
* ensure that assessments (including any interim assessments) are
carried out and reports completed and sent to the appropriate body;
* maintain and retain accurate records of employment that will count
towards the induction period;
* ensure that all monitoring and record keeping is done in the most
streamlined and least burdensome way;
* make the governing body aware of the arrangements that have been put
in place to support ECTs serving induction;
* make a recommendation to the appropriate body on whether the ECT’s
performance against the Teachers’ Standards is satisfactory or requires
an extension;
* participate appropriately in the appropriate body’s quality assurance
procedures; and
* retain all relevant documentation/evidence/forms on file for six
years.
[arabic]
. [[para-5-4]] There may also be circumstances where the headteacher/principal is
expected to:

* obtain interim assessments, any formal assessment and progress reviews
from the ECT’s previous post;
* act early, alerting the appropriate body when necessary, in cases
where an ECT may be at risk of not completing induction satisfactorily;
* ensure third-party observation of an ECT who may be at risk of not
performing satisfactorily against the Teachers’ Standards;
* notify the appropriate body as soon as absences, within each year of
induction, total 30 days or more;
* periodically inform the governing body about the institution’s
induction arrangements;
* advise and agree with the appropriate body where, in exceptional
cases, it may be appropriate to reduce the length of the induction
period or deem that it has been satisfactorily completed;
* consult with the appropriate body in cases where a part-time ECT has
completed a minimum period covering, but not equivalent to, two school
years and has met the necessary requirements, where it may be
appropriate to reduce the length of the induction period;
* provide interim assessment reports for staff moving school in between
formal assessment periods; and
* notify the appropriate body when an ECT serving induction leaves the
institution.
[arabic]
. [[para-5-5]] In addition to the above, headteachers/principals of FE institutions,
independent schools, academies and free schools, BSOs and nursery
schools should also ensure the ECT’s post and responsibilities comply
with the specific requirements for statutory induction in these
settings.

=== Induction tutors

[arabic, start=6]
. [[para-5-6]] The induction tutor (or the headteacher/principal if carrying out this
role) is expected to:

* provide, or coordinate, guidance for the ECT’s professional
development (with the appropriate body where necessary);
* carry out regular progress reviews throughout the induction period;
* undertake two formal assessment meetings during the total induction
period coordinating input from other colleagues as appropriate (normally
one at the end of term three and one at the end of term six, or pro rata
for part-time staff);
* carry out progress reviews in terms where a formal assessment does not
occur;
* inform the ECT following progress review meetings of the determination
of their progress against the Teachers’ Standards and share progress
review records with the ECT, headteacher and appropriate body;
* inform the ECT during the assessment meeting of the judgements to be
recorded in the formal assessment record and invite the ECT to add their
comments;
* ensure that the ECT’s teaching is observed and feedback provided;
* ensure ECTs are aware of how, both within and outside the institution,
they can raise any concerns about their induction programme or their
personal progress;
* take prompt, appropriate action if an ECT appears to be having
difficulties; and
* ensure that all monitoring and record keeping is done in the most
streamlined and least burdensome way, and that requests for evidence
from ECTs do not require new documentation but draw on existing working
documents.

=== Mentors

[arabic, start=7]
. [[para-5-7]] The mentor (or the induction tutor if carrying out this role) is
expected to:

* regularly meet with the ECT for structured mentor sessions to provide
effective targeted feedback;
* work collaboratively with the ECT and other colleagues involved in the
ECT’s induction within the same school to help ensure the ECT receives a
high-quality ECF-based induction programme;
* provide, or broker, effective support, including phase or subject
specific mentoring and coaching; and
* take prompt, appropriate action if an ECT appears to be having
difficulties.

=== Appropriate bodies

[arabic, start=8]
. [[para-5-8]] The appropriate body has the main quality assurance role within the
induction process. Through quality assurance, the appropriate body
should assure itself that:

* headteachers/principals (and governing bodies where appropriate) are
aware of, and are capable of meeting their responsibilities for
monitoring support and assessment. This includes checking that an ECT
receives an ECF-based induction programme, a designated induction tutor
and mentor, and the reduced timetable; and
* the monitoring, support, assessment and guidance procedures in place
are fair and appropriate.
[arabic]
. [[para-5-9]] Only those organisations set out in Section 4(2) of the 2012
Regulations can act as appropriate bodies and their functions must not
be delegated. Within Teaching School Hubs (TSHs) the appropriate body is
the designated lead school. For every ECT that is claimed by a TSH in
its capacity as an appropriate body, the TSH cannot delegate or share
its appropriate body responsibilities towards that ECT with another TSH,
AB, third party or across a wider network or partnership of bodies. The
appropriate body may work with third parties or partners who can support
or facilitate the delivery of the roles and responsibilities. But where
the appropriate body chooses to work with partners, the appropriate body
itself must still:

* Retain full responsibility for regulatory duties and powers including
overseeing induction and must directly take all decisions on agreeing
reductions and extensions with the ECT and recommendations to pass or
fail induction which would all be based on its own consideration of
relevant evidence.
* Make direct decisions in every case concerning the suitability of
posts and institutions, appropriate action where schools are not
complying with requirements or actions taken to support ECTs’ progress.
* Maintain oversight of and accountability for all activities undertaken
by third parties, and ensure services are conducted according to the
agreed operating policies and processes of the appropriate body and this
statutory guidance.
[arabic]
. [[para-5-10]] The appropriate body should, on a regular basis, consult with
headteachers/principals on the nature and extent of the quality
assurance procedures it operates, or wishes to introduce. Institutions
are required to work with the appropriate body to enable it to discharge
its responsibilities effectively.
. [[para-5-11]] The appropriate body is expected to take steps to ensure that:

* headteachers/principals have put in place an ECF-based induction
programme for the ECT and that their programme of support is clearly
based on the ECF;
* headteachers/principals (and governing bodies where appropriate) are
meeting their responsibilities in respect of providing a suitable post
for induction;
* the monitoring, support, assessment and guidance procedures in place
are fair and appropriate;
* where an ECT may be experiencing difficulties, action is taken to
address areas of performance that require further development and
support;
* where an institution is not fulfilling its responsibilities, contact
is made with the institution to raise its concerns;
* induction tutors have the ability and sufficient time to carry out
their role effectively;
* mentors have the ability and sufficient time to carry out their role
effectively;
* headteachers/principals are consulted on the nature and extent of the
quality assurance procedures it operates, or wishes to introduce;
* any agreement entered into with either an FE institution or an
independent school’s governing body is upheld;
* the headteacher/principal has verified that the award of QTS has been
made; the school is providing a reduced timetable in addition to PPA
time;
* the ECT is provided with a named contact (or contacts) within the
appropriate body with whom to raise concerns;
* FE institutions (including sixth-form colleges) are supported in
finding schools for ECTs to spend ten days teaching children of
compulsory school age in a school;
* ECTs’ records, progress reviews and assessment reports are maintained;
** headteachers/principals have obtained or have been provided with
interim assessments, any formal assessment and progress reviews from the
ECT’s previous post;
** the school is submitting progress reviews and assessment reports
(including any interim assessments) on time;
* all monitoring and record keeping is done in the most streamlined and
least burdensome way and that requests for evidence from ECTs do not
require new documentation but draw on existing working documents;
* agreement is reached with the ECT and the headteacher/principal is
consulted where a reduced induction period may be appropriate or is
deemed to be satisfactorily completed;
* agreement is reached with the ECT and the headteacher/principal is
consulted in cases where a part-time ECT has completed a minimum period
covering, but not equivalent to, two school years and has met the
necessary requirements where a reduced induction period may be
appropriate;
* a final decision is made on whether the ECT’s performance against the
Teachers’ Standards is satisfactory or an extension is required and the
relevant parties are notified; and
* they provide the Teaching Regulation Agency with details of ECTs who
have started; completed (satisfactorily or not); require an extension
to; or left school partway through an induction period; together with
details of the type of induction an ECT is accessing (see para <<para-2-41,2.41>>).

* retain all relevant documentation/evidence/forms on file for six
years.
[arabic]
. [[para-5-12]] The appropriate body should also (as local capacity, resources and
agreements allow):

* respond to requests from headteachers/principal to obtain interim
assessments, any formal assessment and progress reviews from the ECTs
previous post;
* respond to requests from schools and colleges for guidance, support
and assistance with ECTs’ induction programmes;
* provide information to the headteacher on the types of induction
available; and
* respond to requests for assistance and advice with training for
induction tutors and mentors.

=== The governing body 

[arabic, start=13]
. [[para-5-13]] The governing body:

* should ensure compliance with the requirement to have regard to this
guidance;
* should be satisfied that the institution has the capacity to support
the ECT;
* should ensure the headteacher/principal is fulfilling their
responsibility to meet the requirements of a suitable post for
induction;
* must investigate concerns raised by an individual ECT as part of the
institution’s agreed grievance procedures;
* can seek guidance from the appropriate body on the quality of the
institution’s induction arrangements and the roles and responsibilities
of staff involved in the process; and
* can request general reports on the progress of an ECT.

=== Teaching Regulation Agency

[arabic, start=14]
. [[para-5-14]] The Teaching Regulation Agency will carry out specific duties on
behalf of the Secretary of State, including:

** Statutory 
* hearing appeals; and
* ensuring that the names of ECTs who have failed induction are included
on the list of persons who have failed to satisfactorily complete an
induction period.

** Non-statutory 
* recording the progress of ECTs through their induction process and
providing details of teachers who have passed or failed induction to
employers through the Employer Access Online service.
