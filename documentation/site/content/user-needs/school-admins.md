title: User needs for school admins
---

Our service is used by school administrators. Most of these are usually school induction tutors. 

The following are the core user needs for school users, which have been identified and validated through user research. 

**As a** school user, **I need** a clear understanding of all steps involved and information needed in the registration process for mentors and Early Career Teachers (ECTs), **so that** I can gather all the information I need, and register my participants in a timely and effective manner.

**As a** school user, **I need** to be able to complete registration in a way which minimises duplication, **so that** I don't have to spend time entering the same information on multiple different digital services. 

**As a** school user, **I need** a clear channel to communicate issues to the Department for Education (DfE), **so that** I can get timely support to assist me with the registration process if I need it.

**As a** school user, **I need** it to be clearly communicated to me when I have successfully registered all my ECTs and mentors, **so that** I can feel reassured that I have fulfilled my responsibilities in setting up my ECTs for induction. 

**As a** school user, **I need** to understand the roles that different bodies play in ECF and who fulfils them in relation to my school, **so that** I can get training and induction set up for my ECTs successfully and with the correct partnerships in place.

**As a** school user, **I need** access to comprehensive guidance mechanisms that elucidate ECTE policy requirements and provide step-by-step instructions for online and offline processes **so that** I can effectively set up and manage ECTE induction and training for my ECTs.
