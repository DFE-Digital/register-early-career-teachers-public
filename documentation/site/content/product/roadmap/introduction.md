## Why we're sharing our roadmap publicly 
This document explains what we're working on to improve and rebuild the digital services that facilitate the early career framework (ECF) policy reforms. These digital services are named Register early career teachers.

It sets out what we're working on now, what will come next, and what we might pursue later. 

By sending this out publicly, we hope to:

* give direction to our team
* be transparent about what we're working on and why
* gather more feedback about the work we're aiming to do

All of these items of work are related [to our objectives as a team.](/product/objectives) 

Our objectives are centered around how we can make it easier for schools, lead providers and appropriate bodies to support or train ECTs and mentors.


## What we've already done

So far, we have:

* built a way for schools to register ECTs and mentors to save school's time and improve data accuracy
* set up DfE Sign in for appropriate bodies, so we can improve how all users access the service
* improved how mentors are assigned to ECTs, so we can reduce having to chase schools to tell us mentor information
* built a service for appropriate bodies to record data about inductions individually, so we can start to consolidate services and reduce workload for all users
* set up how we want to migrate data from ECF1 to the new Register early career teachers service
* designed how ECTs and mentors are registered when they are moving schools
