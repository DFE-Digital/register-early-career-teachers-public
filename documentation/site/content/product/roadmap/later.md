We will:

* improve the API documentation, so lead provider users can see the guidance applicable to them and understand it easily
* calculate financial information, so that we can pay lead providers the correct amounts for training
* enable appropriate bodies to check training data for early career teachers, in the same service where they submit induction data, so we can save them time and improve data accuracy
* consider if we need to gather the school induction tutor for schools so we can reduce confusion for schools whilst making sure lead providers have the information they need
* work out how to notify school of changes that have happened in training or where they need to act in the service, so data is kept updated for training and funding to take place quickly
