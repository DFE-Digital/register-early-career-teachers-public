We will:

* consider if we need to gather the school induction tutor for schools so we can reduce confusion for schools whilst making sure lead providers have the information they need
* work out how to notify school of changes that have happened in training or where they need to act in the service, so data is kept updated for training and funding to take place quickly
* work out how we might integrate with the third party services which appropriate bodies use to manage inductions, so we can make it easier to record inductions
