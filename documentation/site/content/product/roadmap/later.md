We will:

* respond to support tickets and queries after our initial release, so we can make improvements to the service as needed
* add to the API fields we couldn't for our initial release, such as working pattern, school start date or induction status, which will speed up onboarding to training and make management of training easier for schools and lead providers
* look at how we can reduce the complexity of schedules, so that we can simplify validation and make management of training easier for lead providers
* explore how we can reduce the burden of registration and management of early career teacher training and induction for schools
* work out how to notify school of changes that have happened in training or where they need to act in the service, so data is kept updated for training and funding to take place quickly
* work out how we might integrate with the third party services which appropriate bodies use to manage inductions, so we can make it easier to record inductions
