We are:

* building how schools tell us ECTs or mentors have left a school, so we get more up to date information that can help improve training and policy decisions
* working out the logic for how to default an ECT or mentor to a particular schedule, so we reduce workload and increase accuracy for lead providers
* building ways for lead providers to defer, withdraw, resume or change schedules for participants
* planning how we test the service end to end, from what schools register to what lead providers see over the API
* planning communications, guidance and support for schools for the transition between the services
* responding to lead provider feedback on the API specification draft, so we can improve how the rest of the API is built to better meet their needs
* adding more API guidance, so we can try to improve understanding of how the APi functions
* continuing to migrate data and working out how we can inform lead providers of data changes
* designing how to expose the data that schools record to appropriate bodies (replacing the Check Data for Appropriate Bodies service) and vice versa, so that it's easier to see induction and training data in the same place
* exploring how the service will notify appropriate bodies when schools make changes on the service, to reduce the need for schools to communicate in offline, duplicative ways
