## Now 🏃

We are:

* starting to build the first parts of our API, so we can start testing it with lead providers
* building the first draft of the API guidance, so lead provider users can see the guidance applicable to them and understand it easily
* creating designs and building financial statements for internal users, so they can understand how lead providers need to be paid for training
* AB STUFF TO BE ADDED ON BULK UPLOAD AND OTHER CHANGES
