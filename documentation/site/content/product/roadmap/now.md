## Now üèÉ

We are:

* starting to build the first parts of our API, so we can start testing it with lead providers
* building the first draft of the API guidance, so lead provider users can see the guidance applicable to them and understand it easily
* creating designs and building financial statements for internal users, so they can understand how lead providers need to be paid for training
* designing how to expose the data that schools record to appropriate bodies (replacing the Check Data for Appropriate Bodies service) and vice versa, so that it's easier to see induction and training data in the same place
* exploring how the service will notify appropriate bodies when schools make changes on the service, to reduce the need for schools to communicate in offline, duplicative ways
