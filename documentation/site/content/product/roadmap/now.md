## Now 🏃

We are:
* improving how early career teachers are transferred between different schools, so that all users have the information they need and can make changes easily
* setting up how records for early career teachers and mentors are viewed, so school users can understand what's happening and make changes when needed
* cleaning up the data we've set up processes to migrate, starting with induction records
* releasing the new service for appropriate bodies to record inductions, so we can improve data quality and consolidate training and induction information
* working on our support console, so it can support all of our users internally and externally
