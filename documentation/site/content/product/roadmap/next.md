## Next ➡️

We will:

* consider how to indicate when early career teachers have left for other reasons, so we can reduce confusion for schools and lead providers
* finish work on the API for lead providers, so we can send them information from schools and pay them for providing training
* improve how the API works, so lead providers can submit the data they need and have it validated correctly, saving them time and improving our data quality
* build a check using this API to make sure migrated data is correct
* improve our admin and finance console, so all our users can get the information and support they need
* work out how to communicate best with schools on the transition between services, including how to contact us for support
* improve how schools can make changes to ECT and mentor records, so we can get more accurate information for them
* enable appropriate bodies to check training data for early career teachers, in the same service where they submit induction data, so we can save them time and improve data accuracy
* consider how to enable appropriate bodies to record induction updates ahead of time, so that they can more effectively manage their workload
