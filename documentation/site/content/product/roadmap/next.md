## Next ➡️

We will:

* consider how to indicate when early career teachers have left for other reasons, so we can reduce confusion for schools and lead providers
* start work on the API for lead providers, so we can send them information from schools and pay them for providing training
* improve how the API works, so lead providers can submit the data they need and have it validated correctly, saving them time and improving our data quality
* build a check using this API to make sure the migrated data is correct
* build a way for appropriate bodies to efficiently record inductions in bulk to reduce their workload
* work out how we might integrate with the third party services which appropriate bodies use to manage inductions, so we can make it easier to record inductions
* improve the record inductions service with appropriate bodies to better meet their needs in peak periods
