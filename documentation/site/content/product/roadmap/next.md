## Next ➡️

We will:

* finish work on the API for lead providers, so we can send them information from schools and pay them for providing training
* finish all improvements to our admin and finance console, so all our users can get the information and support they need
* work out all the data changes necessary as part of migrating from the existing service to Register ECTs
* plan deadlines and testing windows the API, so lead providers can have time to test changes thoroughly and accurately
* test with schools end to end that the service works for them, so we derisk our initial launch
* improve performance of the API
* enable appropriate bodies to check training data for early career teachers, in the same service where they submit induction data, so we can save them time and improve data accuracy
* consider how to enable appropriate bodies to record induction updates ahead of time, so that they can more effectively manage their workload
