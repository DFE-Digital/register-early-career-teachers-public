Hello ((sit_name)),

## You are the induction tutor for ((school_name))

((school_name)) has told us that you’re the induction tutor for the early career teacher entitlement (ECTE) at the school.

## The early career teacher entitlement (ECTE)

The ECTE is designed to help early career teachers (ECTs) during their first few years. Induction tutors play an important role in the ECTE.

## What this means for you

You’ll be the school’s point of contact for the ECTE. We share your name and email with your school’s appropriate bodies and lead providers (if your school is using provider-led training).

You’ll be responsible for:

- registering ECTs and mentors for training as part of their ECTE< 
- managing ECT and mentor changes during ECTE

We need this information to arrange the correct funding and access to training.

## If your school has never registered ECTs or mentors for ECTE

Find out what you need to do with our [setting up and managing early career teacher entitlement guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/set-up-and-manage-the-early-career-teacher-entitlement).

## Register and manage ECTs and mentors

You’ll need to use our [register early career teachers](https://staging.register-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/) service to register and manage changes.</p>

To use the service, you’ll need a [DfE Sign-in](https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/) account with approved access to:</p>
