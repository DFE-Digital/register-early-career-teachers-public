Hello ((mentor_name)),

You’ve been registered as a mentor for early career teachers (ECTs) at ((school)).

## What this means

You’ll support ECTs at your school as part of their early career teacher entitlement (ECTE). Your school induction tutor will assign ECTs to you.

## Mentor training

If your school is using a ‘provider-led’ training programme, you might get up to 20 hours of mentor training. Speak to your school’s induction tutor about mentor training.

Speak to your school’s induction tutor if you have questions about how ECTE works at your school.
