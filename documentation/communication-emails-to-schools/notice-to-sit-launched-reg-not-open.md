### Subject: Registering early career teachers and mentors with the Department for Education (DfE)

---

Hello ((sit_name)),

We’re sending you this email as our records show that you're the induction tutor for ((school_name)).

We’re making changes to the way schools register and manage ECTs and mentors online with the DfE.

Schools need to use our [register early career teachers](https://staging.register-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/) service. We’ve closed the manage training for early career teachers service.

## What these changes mean for your school

### Access and sign in is different from the current service
Users of the new service will need to have an account with [DfE Sign-in](https://services.signin.education.gov.uk).
DfE Sign-in is a single sign-on service that provides access to DfE services. Your school might already use it for other DfE services.

### How DfE Sign-in works

1. Schools need to appoint a DfE Sign-in approver. This person verifies the identity of users before giving access to services. The approver is often the headteacher or administrator.   
2. Users who want access to DfE services need to create a DfE Sign-in account. They use their account to select their school and request access to services.

You can get help with [DfE Sign-in](https://edd-help.signin.education.gov.uk/contact).

## Changes to the service

### More than one school user can use the register service
Your school’s DfE Sign-in approver can give access to the register early career teachers service to multiple users.

### Lead provider training for ECTs and mentors
Lead providers can be selected for individual ECTs and mentors (if your school uses a provider-led training programme). 

### Manage ECTs and mentors leaving schools
You can now tell us when an ECT or mentor has left your school and is not expected to return.

### Notification of induction tutor
You can tell us about, and change, your main induction tutor.  

## What happens next

You can use the new service to manage your existing ECTs and mentors. 

We’ll email you when registration for the 2026-2027 academic year opens.

## Sign in

Sign in to [register early career teachers](https://staging.register-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/).
