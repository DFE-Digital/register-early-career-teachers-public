### Subject: You’ve been registered for early career teacher training and support

---

Hello ((early_career_teacher_name)),

((school)) has registered you for a training programme for early career teachers (ECTs).

The training is part of your 2-year early career teacher entitlement (ECTE). It aims to support you during your first years as a qualified teacher.

You’ll get:

- early career training 
- support from a mentor at your school 
- time off from your timetable to take part in training activities

## Your training programme

Your school is designing and delivering its own training programme (we call this ‘school-led’). Your school’s induction tutor or your mentor will tell you about your programme.

## Help and information

You can read more about ECT training and support in our [ECT guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-career-teachers-your-training-and-support-entitlement).
