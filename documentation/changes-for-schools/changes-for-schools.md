# Register early career teacher service: changes for schools

The launch of the register early career teacher service means a number of changes for schools. 

The objective of this document is to explain to lead providers and appropriate bodies the changes to the Register early career teachers (ECTs) service for schools.  

We hope this will make it easier for lead providers and appropriate bodies to support schools with the transition between the existing services to Manage early career teacher training and the new Register ECTs service. 

All of these changes have been tested in research with schools. 

## Using DfE Sign in to access the service 

### Using DfE sign in

Schools will now use DfE Sign in to access the Register ECTs service. 

You can use [DfE Sign in here](https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/) or [read guidance for using DfE Sign in here](https://edd-help.signin.education.gov.uk/contact).

### Allowing multiple users to sign in

As part of using DfE Sign in, multiple people working for a school can now gain access to the Register ECTs service. Previously, only 1 person could be nominated as the school induction tutor and access the service. 

### Nominating a school induction tutor separately

As part of the change to the DfE Sign in, we now ask schools whenever they first sign in after the opening of a new registration period to confirm their school induction tutor. They can also click to access and update this information at any point.

## Schools no longer have to provide the name of an ECT or mentor to register them 

In Register ECTs, when a school registers an ECT or mentor, they only provide the: 

- teacher reference number (TRN)
- date of birth

They no longer need to provide a name. 
 
If the TRN and date of birth are correct, we will show them the name of the ECT or mentor to confirm. 

If they are incorrect, we ask for the national insurance number. If this is also incorrect or not provided, they will not be able to progress with registering the ECT or mentor. 

If the name is out of date or is spelt wrong, the school may correct it. However, they must not do this to name a different person. Schools must only correct spelling or update legal name changes. 

This will be monitored after release of the service.

## New questions we ask schools when they register early career teachers 

When an early career teacher is being registered on the new service, we ask schools some additional questions. These are outlined below. 

### Schools need to tell us the ECT’s working pattern 

This question specifically wants to know their working pattern as an ECT. 

If they work part-time as an ECT and part-time as a teaching assistant, or in another role (totalling full-time), we'd still expect schools to select part-time here.

### Schools need to tell us when they started as an ECT at your school

This question tries to identify when they have started as an ECT at the school. This is different to when they may have started working at a school prior to becoming an ECT, e.g. as an unqualified or trainee teacher.

### We ask for the lead provider when a school has either not had a partnership with a lead provider before or chooses not to use the existing partnership(s)

Most schools will have an existing valid partnership from a previous or current academic year with a lead provider and delivery partner, which they can select to use for training their ECTs. However, if they decline to use that partnership or do not have any existing valid partnerships, we ask what lead provider they want to train their ECT. This is then approved by a lead provider over the API when they submit a partnership, and shows to schools as confirmed later on the ECTs page.

## Choices of appropriate body, lead provider and delivery partner are set per ECT, not per cohort year 

In the existing services, schools:

- are only allowed to view and select one appropriate body for all of their ECTs 
- can only see one lead provider and delivery partner for all of their ECTs and mentors 

This is the case even when their ECTs and mentors may be training with different lead providers or delivery partners.

In Register ECTs, we will ask for each ECT these details based on what they have most recently used to register their existing ECTs. This information will either be from the current academic year or a historic one.

## Appropriate body is now a compulsory question when registering an ECT 

When registering an ECT, schools will have to tell us the appropriate body. They cannot skip the question.

## Schools can change more fields about their ECTs without contacting DfE Support 

Schools can now change the following information about their ECTs after they are registered, but before they have completed induction:

- Name
- Email address 
- Mentor
- Working pattern  
- Training programme 
- Lead provider

## Schools can tell us when an ECT or mentor has left their school for any reason, not just when they’ve changed schools

In the existing services, schools could only tell us when an ECT or mentor was leaving to move to another school. Now, schools can tell us when an ECT or mentor is leaving and not expected to return for any reason.

For example, if they are leaving the teaching profession or they’re unsure if they’re moving school.

## We show schools if mentors can receive training when registering a mentor, and ask for their lead provider

If a mentor is eligible for mentor training, we now tell schools this. We tell them we’ll pass it on to the lead provider for the ECT they’re being assigned to, but they can change it to another lead provider if needed with the link at the bottom.
