# Register early career teacher service: changes for schools

The launch of the register early career teacher service means a number of changes for schools. 

This page describes these changes.

<!-- The objective of this document is to explain to lead providers and appropriate bodies the changes to the Register early career teachers (ECTs) service for schools.  -->

<!-- We hope this will make it easier for lead providers and appropriate bodies to support schools with the transition between the existing services to Manage early career teacher training and the new Register ECTs service. 

All of these changes have been tested in research with schools. -->

## DfE Sign-in is required to access the service 

Schools will need to use DfE Sign-in to approve and manage access to the service. Typically, schools will nominate a DfE Sign-in approver to manange these activities.

Users of the service, for example, induction tutors, will need a DfE sign-in account and approved access to the service.

You can access [DfE Sign in](https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/).

You can read [guidance on using DfE Sign in](https://edd-help.signin.education.gov.uk/contact).

### Multiple users can have access to the service

As part of using DfE Sign-in, multiple people working for a school can now get access to the service. Previously, only 1 person could be nominated as the school induction tutor and access the service. 

### Nominating a school induction tutor separately

As part of the change to the DfE Sign in, we now ask schools to tell us their induction tutor. Schools do this:
- when they first sign in after the opening of a new registration period  
- any other time within the service

## No longer a requirement to provide the ECT or mentor name to register them 

When a school registers an ECT or mentor, they only need to provide the: 

- teacher reference number (TRN)
- date of birth

They no longer need to provide a name. 
 
The service will display the name of the ECT or mentor for the user to confirm if the TRN and date of birth are correct. 

If they are incorrect, we ask for the national insurance number. If this is incorrect or not provided, ECT or mentor registration cannot be completed. 

If the name is wrong, the school can correct it. However, they must not do this to name a different person. Schools must only correct spelling or update legal name changes. 

This will be monitored after release of the service.

## New questions we ask when registering ECTs 

We ask schools some additional questions when registering ECTs. 

### Working pattern 

We ask if the ECT is working a full or part-time pattern. 

This applies to their working pattern as an ECT only. For example, if the ECT works full-time overall, but only part-time as an ECT, they should be recorded as part-time.

<!-- If they work part-time as an ECT and part-time as a teaching assistant, or in another role (totalling full-time), we'd still expect schools to select part-time here. -->

### ECT start date

We ask when the person started at the school as an ECT. Meaning, not when they started working at a school before becoming an ECT. For example, as an unqualified or trainee teacher.

### We ask for the lead provider when a school has either not had a partnership with a lead provider before or chooses not to use the existing partnership(s)

Most schools will have an existing valid partnership from a previous or current academic year with a lead provider and delivery partner, which they can select to use for training their ECTs. However, if they decline to use that partnership or do not have any existing valid partnerships, we ask what lead provider they want to train their ECT. This is then approved by a lead provider over the API when they submit a partnership, and shows to schools as confirmed later on the ECTs page. 

<a href="../images/select-lead-provider.png" target="blank"><img alt="Select lead provider for ECT when adding them to the service" src="../images/select-lead-provider.png" width="300"/></a>

## The appropriate body, lead provider and delivery partner are set for each ECT, not for the cohort year 

Schools can assign an appropriate body, lead provider and delivery partner for individual ECTs. Schools can change the the default information during ECT registration.

<!-- In the existing services, schools:

- are only allowed to view and select one appropriate body for all of their ECTs 
- can only see one lead provider and delivery partner for all of their ECTs and mentors -->

<!-- This is the case even when their ECTs and mentors may be training with different lead providers or delivery partners. -->

<!-- In Register ECTs, we will ask for each ECT these details based on what they have most recently used to register their existing ECTs. This information will either be from the current academic year or a historic one. -->

## Appropriate body is mandatory 

Schools have to tell us the ECT's appropriate body.

## Schools can make more changes without contacting DfE Support 

After ECTs are registered but before they've completed induction, schools can change the following ECT information:

- Name
- Email address 
- Mentor
- Working pattern  
- Training programme 
- Lead provider

## Schools can tell us when an ECT or mentor has left their school for any reason, not just when they’ve changed schools

Schools can now tell us when an ECT or mentor is leaving and not expected to return for any reason. For example, if they are leaving the teaching profession. 

In the existing service, schools could only tell us when an ECT or mentor was leaving to move to another school. 

<a href="../images/tell-us-if-left-school.png" target="blank"><img alt="Report if ECT has left or is leaving school" src="../images/tell-us-if-left-school.png" width="300"/></a>

## Mentor training and lead provider

When registering a mentor, we tell schools if the mentor is eligible for mentor training. We also tell them we’ll pass the mentor details on to the their assigned ECT's lead provider. They can change it to another lead provider if needed.
