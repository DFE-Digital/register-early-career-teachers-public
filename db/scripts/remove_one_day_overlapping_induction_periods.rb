# We had a problem with imported data where some records were adjusted so they
# had a length of 1 day instead of 0 (no longer allowed). That adjustment meant
# there's a chance they overlap other periods.
#
# We want to delete those periods that:
#   - start on the same day as another period
#   - are 1 day long
#
# The following query:
#   - finds all teachers that have 2 induction periods starting
#     on the same day
#   - finds induction periods belonging to those
#     teachers
#   - limits those induction periods to ones that are 1 day long
#
# with teachers_with_2_induction_periods_starting_on_the_same_day as (
#       select teacher_id, started_on, count(*)
#       from induction_periods
#       group by teacher_id, started_on
#       having count(*) > 1
# )
# select induction_periods.id
# from induction_periods
# inner join teachers on induction_periods.teacher_id = teachers.id
# where teacher_id in (
#       select teacher_id
#       from teachers_with_2_induction_periods_starting_on_the_same_day
# )
# and (finished_on - started_on) = 1
