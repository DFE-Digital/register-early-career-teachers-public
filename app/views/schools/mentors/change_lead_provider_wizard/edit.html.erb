  <p>We recommend that you keep a mentor's lead provider the same until they complete their training.</p>
  <p>If you change <%= @wizard.teacher_full_name %>'s lead provider, it means immediately:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>the old lead provider will no longer have access to <%= @wizard.teacher_full_name %>'s training record</li>
    <li>training will stop and <%= @wizard.teacher_full_name %> will have to wait until the new lead provider confirms the partnership before they can continue</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Changing the lead provider might mean <%= @wizard.teacher_full_name %> will have a different delivery partner. Their training might be delivered differently.</p>
  <p>If you do change lead provider, we'll let the:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>new provider know that you want to work with them</li>
    <li>old provider know they're no longer working with the mentor</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The new provider will confirm the delivery partner they're working with.</p>
