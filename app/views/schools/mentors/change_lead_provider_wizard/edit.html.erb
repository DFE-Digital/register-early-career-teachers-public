  <p>If your school wants to change lead provider, you should, for continuity, make changes at the end of the school year.</p>
  <p>If you change <%= @wizard.teacher_full_name %>'s lead provider it means that their training will stop immediately. They'll need to wait until the new lead provider confirms the partnership before they can continue.</p>
  <p>Changing the lead provider might mean <%= @wizard.teacher_full_name %> will have a different delivery partner. Their training might be delivered differently.</p>
  <p>If you do change lead provider, we'll let the:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>new provider know that you want to work with them</li>
    <li>old provider know they're no longer working with the ECT</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The new provider will confirm the delivery partner they're working with.</p>
