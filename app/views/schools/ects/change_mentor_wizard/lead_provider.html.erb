      An appropriate body is responsible for assuring the quality of the
      statutory induction of ECTs. A lead provider provides the online learning
      platform used for training ECTs and mentors, while the delivery partner
      delivers training events.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      These roles are sometimes undertaken by the same organisation, for
      example an appropriate body might be the same organisation as the
      delivery partner.
