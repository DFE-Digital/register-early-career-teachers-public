  changes at the end of the school year.

  If you change <%= @wizard.teacher_full_name %>’s lead provider it means that
  their training will stop immediately. They’ll need to wait until the new lead
  provider confirms the partnership before they can continue.

  Changing the lead provider might mean that <%= @wizard.teacher_full_name %>
  will have a different delivery partner. Their training might be delivered
