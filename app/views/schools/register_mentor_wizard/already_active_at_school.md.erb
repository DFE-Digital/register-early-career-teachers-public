title: This mentor has already been registered

<%= @mentor.full_name %> has already been registered as a mentor so there's no need to do this again.
You can still continue to assign <%= @mentor.full_name %> to mentor <%= @ect_name %>.

If you meant to register and assign a different mentor to <%= @ect_name %>, you can go back to do this.

<%= form_with(model: @wizard.current_step, url: @wizard.current_step_path) do |f| %>
<%= f.govuk_submit "Assign #{@ect_name} to mentor #{@mentor.full_name}" %>
<% end %>

[Back to ECTs](<%= schools_ects_home_path %>)
