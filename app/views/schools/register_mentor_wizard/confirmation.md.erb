### What happens next

We'll email <%= @mentor.full_name %> to confirm you have registered them.
<% end %>

They do not need to provide us with any further details.

<% if @wizard.ect.provider_led_training_programme? %>
<% if @mentor.funding_available? %>
We'll pass on their details to <%= ECTAtSchoolPeriods::Training.new(@wizard.ect).latest_lead_provider&.name %>
 who will contact them to arrange mentor training.
<% else %>
They cannot do mentor training according to our records.
This could be because they've undertaken it before.
