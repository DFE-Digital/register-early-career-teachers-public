Hello <%= @early_career_teacher_name %>,

<%= @school_name %> has registered you for a training programme for early career teachers (ECTs).

The training is part of your 2-year early career teacher entitlement (ECTE). It aims to support you during your first years as a qualified teacher.

You’ll get:

- early career training
- support from a mentor at your school
- time off from your timetable to take part in training activities

You can read more about what this means for you with our [ECT guidance](<%= @ect_guidance_url %>).

## Your training programme

Your school is designing and delivering its own training programme (we call this ‘school-led’). Your school’s induction tutor or your mentor will tell you about your programme.

## Where to find help and information

You can read more about ECT training and support in our [ECT guidance](<%= @ect_guidance_url %>).

Speak to your school’s induction tutor if you have questions about how your induction or early career training programme works.
