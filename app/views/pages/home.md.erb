You need to do this so your:

- ECTs and mentors can access ECTE training funded by the Department for Education (DfE)
- school receives funding to support their time off timetable for training and mentoring

You should also use this service to update any details you've provided, for example if an ECT leaves or their email changes.

## What your school needs to have in place

Before you use this service, your school needs to have certain things in place to support ECTE.
