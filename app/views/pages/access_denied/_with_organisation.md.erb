You tried to sign in with <%= @organisation_name %> as your organisation.
You do not have approved access to this service with that organisation.

**If you selected the incorrect organisation**, you need to sign out of DfE Sign-in,
before signing in again and select a different organisation.

If you think you should have access to <%= @organisation_name %>, you need to request access from your approver.
You can request access directly from DfE Sign-in.
