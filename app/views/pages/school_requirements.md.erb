Before you use this service, your school needs to have certain things in place to support ECTE.

Your school needs to have:

- appointed an appropriate body
- decided on the training programme it wants to use (provider or school-led)
- partnered with a lead provider (if using a provider-led training programme)

Your school will also need to do the following, but you do not need to do this before you can use this service:

- choose an appropriate person to act as an induction tutor
- choose mentors to support ECTs

Read our guidance on <%= govuk_link_to('setting up and managing ECTE in your school', 'https://www.gov.uk/guidance/set-up-and-manage-the-early-career-teacher-entitlement') %>.

## What you need to register ECTs and mentors

For ECTs and mentors you'll need to provide their:

- name
- teacher reference number (TRN)
- date of birth
- email address
- lead provider

For ECTs only, you'll also need to provide their:

- start date at your school as an ECT
- working pattern (full or part-time)
- appropriate body
- training option (provider or school-led)

## The role of appropriate bodies, lead providers, and delivery partners

An appropriate body is responsible for assuring the quality of the statutory induction of ECTs.

For provider-led training, the lead provider provides the online learning platform used for training ECTs and mentors. The delivery partner delivers training events.

These roles are sometimes done by the same organisation. For example, an appropriate body might be the same organisation as the delivery partner.

For school-led training your school will still work with an appropriate body to quality assure the induction process.
