User sign in details do not match our records.

Check you are using the correct DfE sign in details for the organisation you are signing in as.

If you have not signed in before, you may need to ask an approver at your organisation to give you access.

If you are still having problems, please <%= govuk_link_to('contact support', no_visited_state: true, href: support_path) %>.

---

If **<%= @organisation_name %>** is not the correct organisation, you can try signing in again.

First <%= govuk_link_to('go to DSI and sign out', no_visited_state: true, new_tab: true, href: @dfe_user_account) %>
then <%= govuk_link_to('sign in again', no_visited_state: true, href: sign_in_path) %> with a different organisation.
