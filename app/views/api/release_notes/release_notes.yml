- title: GET participants endpoints added to sandbox   
  date: 2025-01-21
  tags: 
    - sandbox-release 
    - new-field 
    - removed-field
  body: |
    We’ve added the participants endpoints to the ‘Register early career teachers’ API sandbox: 
    
    * `GET /participants` to retrieve data for multiple participants 
    * `GET /participants/{id}` to get information about a single participant 
    
    ## What’s changed from the existing ‘Manage training for early career teachers’ API? 
    
    ### New induction start date field
    
    We’ve introduced the `overall_induction_start_date` field to show when an early career teacher (ECT) officially began their induction, as recorded by their appropriate body. Each ECT will only ever have one induction start date. 
    This field will not be populated over the API until the appropriate body has submitted the induction start date. This may sometimes be after an ECT would be expected to start training. 
    
    #### Why we’ve made this change 
    
    Lead providers requested this field to help:
    
    * confirm when induction has officially started
    * improve onboarding and schedule accuracy
    * identify transfers or ECTs with previous training history 
   
    ### TRN validated field removed
    
    The `trn_validated` field is no longer needed because every participant now needs a validated TRN checked with our records to be registered on the ‘Register ECTs’ service.

    ### Default schedule logic updated
    
    We’ve introduced a new approach for setting default schedules for participants. 
    
    For ECTs, default schedules will be based on school-provided start dates or when they were registered.
    
    For mentors, the logic will relate to: 
    
    * when we expect the mentor to start 
    * if they’re identified by the service as a replacement mentor 
    
    Existing records migrated from ‘Manage training for early career teachers’ will keep their current schedules. 
    
    #### Why we’ve made this change
    
    Lead providers requested this change to help:
    
    * reduce manual scheduling effort
    * automatically align new participants with realistic start times
    
    ### Additional participant status logic
    
    We’ve expanded how the `participant_status` field behaves so that is now shows providers:
    
    * if a participant has been reassigned to a different lead provider
    * if a participant has had their programme type changed to `school-led`
    
    If either value changes after a partnership has been formed, the participant will appear as `left` in the `GET /participants` and `GET /participants/{id}` responses. 
    This ensures they no longer disappear unexpectedly.
    
    #### Why we’ve made this change
    
    Previously, changing lead provider or programme type caused participants to vanish from the API. 
    
    This update improves data continuity and helps providers offboard correctly.
    
    ### Participant visibility updated 
    We’ve changed the logic for which participants are shown to lead providers. 
    
    Providers will now see any participant where both:
    
    * a school has stated at some point they’re the lead provider for that participant
    * a lead provider has either submitted a partnership or it’s been rolled over from a previous cohort by the school 
    
    This includes participants who later:
    
    * change lead provider or programme type
    * leave the school
    
    #### Why we’ve made this change
    
    Previously participants could disappear when partnerships changed.
    
    This update:
    
    * improves visibility and offboarding processes
    * ensures data security when multiple partnerships exist for the same school   

    ### We’ve removed the `withdrawn` attribute from `participant_status`   
    
    To simplify the data model and remove confusion, we’ve decided not to support the `withdrawn` attribute in the `participant_status` field. 
    
    Participants marked as `withdrawn` with no declarations will have their induction records removed. This allows them to be registered correctly at another school.
    
    Participants marked as `withdrawn` with declarations will be corrected to `left` to reflect valid, billable records.
    
    In some cases, participants that were previously visible to lead providers will be removed. These records were created in error and should not have been shared.
    
    We’ll contact affected providers in advance when we make these changes. 
    
    Going forward, if a school reports a participant was registered in error:
    
    * we'll remove the record
    * providers will be notified so they understand why the participant no longer appears in their data  
    
    #### Why we’ve made this change
    
    The withdrawn status was rarely used correctly and often caused confusion for lead providers and schools.
    
    Removing it improves:
    
    * data quality by ensuring only valid participant records are visible
    * clarity by replacing ambiguous `withdrawn` statuses with more accurate `left` records
    * future consistency by making sure new registrations and API responses are cleaner and easier to interpret 
    
    ### ECTs yet to start at a school shown as `joining`
    
    The `participant_status` field will show as `joining` for ECTs whose school start date is in the future, regardless of whether it's their first school or not.
    
    #### Why we’ve made this change
    
    We’ve made this change to give lead providers more accurate, easier-to-understand data through the API.
    
    ### Updated sparsity uplift and pupil premium attributes
    
    Sparsity uplift and pupil premium for mentors will now just show as `false`, rather than a mix of `true` or `false`.  
    
    #### Why we’ve made this change
    
    This uplift is no longer applied to mentors. 
    
    ### More filter options
    
    `GET /participants` can now be filtered by multiple cohorts at once, not just one.
    
    #### Why we’ve made this change
    
    It has the dual benefit of giving more functionality for lead providers and simplifying the endpoint build for us.

    We’ve added the partnerships endpoints to the [‘Register early career teachers’ API sandbox](https://sandbox.register-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/api/docs/v3):
    
    * `GET /partnerships` to retrieve multiple partnerships
    * `GET /partnerships/{id}` to retrieve an individual partnership
    * `POST /partnerships` to create a partnership
    * `PUT /partnerships/{id}` to update a partnership
    
    Read our [partnerships guidance](/api/guidance/guidance-for-lead-providers/create-view-and-update-partnerships) for more detailed information.

    ## What’s changed from the existing ‘Manage training for early career teachers’ API?  
    
    ### Challenge fields removed 
    
    Because schools now make changes at an individual participant level (for example, moving an ECT to a different provider) rather than challenging a school-wide partnership, we’ve removed challenge fields (`challenged_reason`, `challenged_at`, `status`) from partnership responses. 

    ### Providers can now see the number of ECTs or mentors currently training with them for a given partnership 
    
    We’ve added the numeric `participants_currently_training` field in the `GET /partnerships` endpoint. It shows lead providers whether any ECTs or mentors are currently training with them in a partnership.  
    
    ### New expression of interest field 
    
    We’ve introduced the `expression_of_interest` field in the `GET /schools` and `GET /schools/{id}` endpoints to show lead providers whether a school has any participants registered with them for that cohort. This should help lead providers create partnerships with schools that have stated they're training with them.
    
    The attribute holds one of 2 possible response values, `true` or `false`. 

    If a school has expressed interest but no partnership exists, creating one lets the lead provider see the school’s registered participants in the API.
    
    ### Multiple partnerships may appear 
    
    Previously, schools had a default partnership with a single lead provider for each cohort. 
    
    We’ve changed this to reflect that some schools need to set up partnerships with more than one lead provider. 
    
    In the API: 
    
    * `GET /partnerships` may return more than one partnership for the same school and cohort 
    * the `in_partnership` field will state `true` if any partnership exists and `false` if none exist 
    
    ### Earlier partnership submissions allowed 
    
    Lead providers can create a partnership even if the school hasn’t registered participants. The only exceptions are when the cohort has not opened, or the school is doing school-led training.

    We’ve added the `GET /api/v3/schools` and `GET /api/v3/schools/{id}` endpoints in the ['Register early career teachers' v3 API test (sandbox) environment](https://sandbox.register-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/api/docs/v3). 

    ### New `expression_of_interest` field 

    Shows as `true` when at least one participant for that cohort is registered with you as the lead provider. Once a partnership is confirmed, it remains `true` even if all participants later leave that school, change lead provider or change to `school-led` training. 

    ### Updated `induction_programme_choice` logic 

    Now shows `provider-led` if any participant in the cohort is on provider-led training. Shows `school-led` if all participants for that cohort are registered for `school-led` training for the school. Shows `not_yet_known` if no participants have been registered by the school yet. 

    ### Updated `in_partnership` logic 

    Now `true` when at least one partnership exists for the school and cohort, and `false` when none exist. We also now allow multiple partnerships per cohort between different lead providers. However, we'll only allow a lead provider to create one partnership per cohort with a school each for our initial release. 

- title: Delivery partner details available in API sandbox

  body: |
   Lead providers can now view delivery partner details for their schools via `GET /api/v3/delivery-partners` and `GET /api/v3/delivery-partners/{id}` endpoints in the ['Register early career teachers' v3 API test (sandbox) environment](https://sandbox.register-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/api/docs/v3).
  
   There are no changes to the functionality compared to the delivery partner endpoints in the ‘Manage training for early career teachers’ API.
  
   Note that: 
  
   * lead providers will only see delivery partners who they’ve got a partnership with
   * updates, name changes, or removals from a cohort appear in the endpoints 
   * delivery partner IDs follow the ECF1 format 

- title: View financial statements in test environment

  body: |
   Lead providers can now check their financial statements in the ['Register early career teachers' v3 API test (sandbox) environment](https://sandbox.register-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/api/docs/v3).

   Use the `GET /api/v3/statements` endpoint to retrieve all statements or `GET /api/v3/statements/{id}` endpoint to retrieve a specific statement.

   We’ve removed the `type` field from the responses. We used it to differentiate between NPQ and early career training statements, but it's no longer needed.

   We’d welcome feedback on this update before it goes into production. Share any suggestions or concerns via the usual Slack channels.
