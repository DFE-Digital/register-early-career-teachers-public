# Swagger API documentation

## What is Swagger API documentation? 

The [Swagger documentation](relative path “/api/docs/v3”) explains how lead providers connect their organisation’s system to the 'Register early career teachers’ service’s API. 

It includes: 

* a list of all available API endpoints
* required data fields and formats
* response types and error messages

The documentation supports lead providers sending and updating participant data, managing training records, and triggering payment milestones. 

## Who the Swagger documentation is for 

The documentation is designed for technical teams and developers working with lead providers to: 

* manage integration of data for early career teachers and mentors
* submit training declarations that affect funding
* test, update, or debug their system's API calls
