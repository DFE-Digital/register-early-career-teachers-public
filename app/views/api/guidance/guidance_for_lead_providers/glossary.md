## Appropriate body

Appropriate bodies are responsible for assuring the quality of statutory teacher induction by ensuring that those involved understand and can fulfil their responsibilities, and that monitoring, support, assessment, and guidance arrangements are fair and appropriate. They provide the overall induction start date and induction end date, which we show over the API.

## Cohort

The grouping of participants who begin their induction or training in a given academic year under a given funding contract. For example, a participant who started their training in the 2024/25 academic year is assigned to the 2024 cohort. This is because funding for their training comes from the 2024/25 call-off contract. In most cases providers cannot change a participant’s cohort once they have started their training.

## Course identifier

The participant’s training as either an early career teacher (ECT) or mentor.

## Declaration

The notification submitted by providers via the API as the sole means for triggering output payments from DfE. Declarations are submitted where there is evidence of a participant’s engagement in training for a given milestone period.

## Delivery partner

A role played by an organisation where they deliver training events. Lead providers are required each year to submit to DfE what delivery partners they expect to work with for the new cohort. Delivery partners may also be appropriate bodies.

## Participant

## Participant status

It reflects the participant’s position in the school, for example joining, leaving, or withdrawn.

## Partnership

A 3 way relationship between school, lead provider, and delivery partner.

## Qualified teaching status (QTS)

Early career teachers require QTS to be eligible for training with lead providers.  
See: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts

## Schedule

The expected timeframe in which a participant will complete their early career training. Schedules include defined milestone dates (/api reference/ecf/schedules-and-milestone-dates) against GOV.UK.

## Statement

A record of output payments, based on declarations, service fees, and any adjustments the DfE may pay lead providers at the end of a contractually agreed payment period. Statements sent to providers by DfE at the end of milestone periods can be used for invoicing purposes.

## Teacher reference number (TRN)

A unique identifier issued by the Teaching Regulation Agency to an individual teacher.

## Training status

Determines what actions you can take, such as updating data or submitting declarations.

## Transfers

TBC

## Unfunded-mentor

Mentors linked to a provider’s ECTs but not eligible for funding through that provider. Typically, these mentors have either completed, or are currently doing, mentor training with a different lead provider than the one delivering training to the ECT they support.

## Replacement mentors
