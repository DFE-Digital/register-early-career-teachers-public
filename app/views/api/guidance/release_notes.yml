- title: View financial statements in test environment
  date: 2025-06-23
  body: |
   Lead providers can now check their financial statements in the ['Register early career teachers’ v3 API test (sandbox) environment](https://sandbox.register-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/api/docs/v3).
   
   Use the GET/api/v3/statements endpoint to retrieve all statements or GET/api/v3/statements/{id} endpoint to retrieve a specific statement.
   
   We’ve removed the type field from the responses. We used it to differentiate between NPQ and early career training statements, but it's no longer needed.
   
   We’d welcome feedback on this update before it goes into production. Share any suggestions or concerns via the usual Slack channels.
