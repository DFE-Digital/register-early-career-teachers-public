- title: Delivery partner details available in API sandbox 
  date: 2025-08-12
  tags:
    - sandbox-release
  body: |
   Lead providers can now view delivery partner details for their schools via GET `/api/v3/delivery-partners` and GET `/api/v3/delivery-partners/{id}` endpoints in the ['Register early career teachers' v3 API test (sandbox) environment](https://sandbox.register-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/api/docs/v3)
  
   There are no changes to the functionality compared to the delivery partner endpoints in the ‘Manage training for early career teachers’ API.
  
   Note that: 
  
   * lead providers will only see delivery partners who they’ve got a partnership with
   * updates, name changes, or removals from a cohort appear in the endpoints 
   * delivery partner IDs follow the ECF1 format 

- title: View financial statements in test environment

  body: |
   Lead providers can now check their financial statements in the ['Register early career teachers' v3 API test (sandbox) environment](https://sandbox.register-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/api/docs/v3).

   Use the GET `/api/v3/statements` endpoint to retrieve all statements or GET `/api/v3/statements/{id}` endpoint to retrieve a specific statement.

   We’ve removed the type field from the responses. We used it to differentiate between NPQ and early career training statements, but it's no longer needed.

   We’d welcome feedback on this update before it goes into production. Share any suggestions or concerns via the usual Slack channels.
