- title: Schools endpoints now in sandbox for testing  
  date: 2025-08-13
  tags:
    - sandbox-release
  body: |
  We’ve added the GET `/api/v3/schools` and GET `/api/v3/schools/{id}` endpoints in the ['Register early career teachers' v3 API test (sandbox) environment](https://sandbox.register-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/api/docs/v3). 

### New ‘expression_of_interest’ field 

Shows as `TRUE` when at least one participant for that cohort is registered with you as the lead provider. Once a partnership is confirmed, it remains `TRUE` even if all participants later leave that school, change lead provider or change to school-led training. 

### Updated ‘induction_programme_choice’ logic 

Now shows `provider-led` if any participant in the cohort is on provider-led training. Shows `school-led` if all participants for that cohort are registered for school-led training for the school. Shows `not_yet_known` if no participants have been registered by the school yet. 

### Updated ‘in_partnership’ logic 

Now `TRUE` when at least one partnership exists for the school and cohort, and `FALSE` when none exist. We also now allow multiple partnerships per cohort between different lead providers. However, we'll only allow a lead provider to create one partnership per cohort with a school each for our initial release. 

- title: Delivery partner details available in API sandbox

  body: |
   Lead providers can now view delivery partner details for their schools via GET `/api/v3/delivery-partners` and GET `/api/v3/delivery-partners/{id}` endpoints in the ['Register early career teachers' v3 API test (sandbox) environment](https://sandbox.register-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/api/docs/v3)
  
   There are no changes to the functionality compared to the delivery partner endpoints in the ‘Manage training for early career teachers’ API.
  
   Note that: 
  
   * lead providers will only see delivery partners who they’ve got a partnership with
   * updates, name changes, or removals from a cohort appear in the endpoints 
   * delivery partner IDs follow the ECF1 format 

- title: View financial statements in test environment

    - removed-field
  body: |
   Lead providers can now check their financial statements in the ['Register early career teachers' v3 API test (sandbox) environment](https://sandbox.register-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/api/docs/v3).

   Use the GET `/api/v3/statements` endpoint to retrieve all statements or GET `/api/v3/statements/{id}` endpoint to retrieve a specific statement.

   We’ve removed the type field from the responses. We used it to differentiate between NPQ and early career training statements, but it's no longer needed.

   We’d welcome feedback on this update before it goes into production. Share any suggestions or concerns via the usual Slack channels.
