## Repository setup

Register early career teachers has two repositories, [an internal](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/register-ects-project-board) one and [a public one](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/register-early-career-teachers-public).

We write tickets and organise our sprints on the internal repository. The public one is where we write and update code. This helps minimise the risk of accidentally posting sensitive information in a ticket, but still allows for our code to be public and transparent.

We still aim to work as openly as possible and will respond to any issues or pull requests raised against the public repository.
