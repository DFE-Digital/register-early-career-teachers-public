## Repository setup

Register early career teachers has two repositories, [an internal](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/register-ects-project-board) one and [a public one](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/register-early-career-teachers-public).

We work on the internal one and regularly publish code to the public one. This helps minimise the risk of accidentally posting sensitive information in an issue or pull request.

We still aim to work as openly as possible and will respond to any issues or pull requests raised against the public repository.
